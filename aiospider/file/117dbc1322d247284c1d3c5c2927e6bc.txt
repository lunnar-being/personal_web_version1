These guides apply to proposals for:


  mineral extraction
  landfill and land raising (structures made from above ground waste) – referred to as ‘landfilling’ in these guides


Planning authorities and developers should use the guide for reclaiming mineral extraction and landfill sites to agriculture when considering proposals that affect agricultural land in England.

You should use the planning and aftercare advice to make sure developers understand what’s needed to reclaim sites to agriculture.
