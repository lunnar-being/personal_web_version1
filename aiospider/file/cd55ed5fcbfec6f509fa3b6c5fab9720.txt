Today, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in partnership with the  (CESMII), announced selections for four new Smart Manufacturing Innovation Centers (SMICs) bringing the total to eight SMICs. Through specialized training and direct industry engagement, the centers will help U.S. manufacturers implement smart manufacturing technologies to optimize their use of energy and materials.“Smart Manufacturing makes the American manufacturing sector more productive, energy efficient, and competitive on a global scale,” said Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Kelly Speakes-Backman. “DOE's investments in Smart Manufacturing will accelerate the adoption of these technologies and processes, while developing a highly skilled manufacturing workforce for the future.”With the SMIC network of industry, government, and academia, selected projects will allow manufacturers of varying sizes to tap into CESMII’s vast smart manufacturing resources and cultivate the manufacturing workforce of the future. These SMICs help CESMII expand institute-developed technologies, training, and hands-on demonstrations that will increase the widespread adoption of smart manufacturing technologies.Selected centers include:  Founded in 2016, CESMII accelerates smart manufacturing adoption through the integration of advanced sensors, data analytics, platforms, and controls. It is the third institute funded by DOE’s .
