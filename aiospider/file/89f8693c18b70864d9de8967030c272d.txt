This guide is for British citizens travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa or permit.

Entry requirements

If you’re going to Croatia to work (or any other EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) you must make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements.

On the day you travel, you’ll need your passport to both:


  have at least 6 months left
  be less than 10 years old (even if it has 6 months or more left)


If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attend business meetings. These are usually covered by the Schengen visa waiver.

Although Croatia isn’t in the Schengen area it still applies the 90-day rule, but it applies it differently.

If you’re going for other types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.

Croatia’s authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.


You must always check with Croatia’s government before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements.


If you’re working in more than one country you’ll need to check the entry rules of each country.

If you need a passport, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.

Visa and permit documents

This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in Croatia. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.

It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with Croatia’s authorities or embassy.

You must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:


  translated
  
‘legalised’ (apostillised) or notarised
  originals, or if copies are acceptable
  signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)
  dated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application


Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa. This guide uses the same terms used in Croatia, so you know which ones to use when speaking to Croatia’s authorities.

Check if you need a visa or permit

Croatia is not in the Schengen area.

The Schengen area countries apply the 90-day visa waiver rule as a group. This means if you visit one or more of the Schengen area countries within a 180 day-period, it all counts towards the Schengen 90-day limit.

Croatia applies a separate 90-day limit. It doesn’t apply the 90 days as a group within the Schengen area countries.

This means you can spend up to 90 days in a 180-day period in other European countries and it won’t affect how long you can spend in Croatia. You’ll still be able to stay in Croatia visa-free for up to 90 days in a 180-day period.

You don’t need a visa or permit if you’re travelling to Croatia for up to 90 days in a 180-day period for:


  running or attending job interviews
  going to court as witness
  attending trade fairs
  attending conferences (not presenting)
  attending board meetings
  meeting clients or customers
  meeting colleagues, contractors or sellers
  touring a company facility
  team building activities


These activities are covered by the Schengen visa waiver.

Border checks

At the border, you may be asked to show:


  proof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets
  health insurance that covers your entire stay
  proof of accommodation for your entire stay
  enough money for the duration of your trip
  an invitation letter from your employer explaining your trip


Check Croatia’s exemptions

Certain types of work and activities do not require a visa or permit because they’re exempt.

All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.

The following may not require a visa or permit in Croatia for up to 90 days in a 180-day period:


  those carrying out activities related to the incorporation and registration of a company or sole proprietorship (‘craft business’ (obrt))
  those with an EU intra-company transfer (EU ICT) permit from another country – the Croatian company must send a posted worker declaration to the Ministry of Labour, by email or post


Exemptions are covered by the visa waiver.

Show proof of exemption

You need to be able to show proof that you’re exempt to the authorities on request. This could be your EU ICT permit if you have one.

Further checks

If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from Croatia’s embassy or immigration authorities.

Applying for a visa or permit

This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit to help you prepare, but you’ll need to check the exact rules and processes with Croatia’s embassy or immigration authorities.

Taking your family

If you have a family they won’t be able to get dependant visas if you’re working in Croatia short term. They may be able to join you for up to 90 days under the visa waiver.

Partners, and children under 18 may be able to join you if you have a long-term permit.

Registering short-term work and permits for long-term work

If you’re working temporarily in Croatia for up to 90 days you need to apply for a work registration certificate.

You must apply for a long-term permit if you’re in Croatia because you’re:


  transferring from a UK-based company to a Croatian branch
  working for a Croatian company in Croatia on a Croatian contract
  providing services to a client in Croatia
  carrying out self-employed work
  investing in or donating money to Croatia
  conducting research work
  working in Croatia as a digital nomad


Long-term permits are valid for up to 1 year depending on which one you need.

Registering short-term work

You need either a 30-day or 90-day work registration certificate depending on what work you’re carrying out in Croatia.

30-day work registration certificate

You need a 30-day certificate if you’re:


  taking part in fairs or exhibitions where your employer is exhibiting
  a writer or performer in musicals, stage performances and dance, as well as accompanying reporters, organisational and technical staff

  a reporter or organisational or technical crew at a sports event or competition

  an intern working for the Croatian branch of a UK-based company
  carrying out professional training or education for employees in Croatia
  delivering, installing or servicing machinery and equipment as part of a contract or warranty
  carrying out funeral activities in line with the Croatian regulations


90-day certificate

You need a 90-day certificate if you’re:


  a service provider for tourism or a tourist agent
