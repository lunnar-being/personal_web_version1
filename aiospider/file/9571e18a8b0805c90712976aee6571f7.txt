This guidance provides evidence-based interventions and advice on how dental health professionals can improve and maintain the oral and general health of their patients.

Many of the risk factors for general health conditions also affect oral health, such as:


  poor diet
  smoking
  alcohol misuse


The guidance includes advice on how to prevent the main oral diseases dental caries, periodontal diseases, oral cancer and tooth wear (which can be found in chapter 2)  with additional advice on:


  the use of fluoride
  brushing your teeth
  eating a healthy balanced diet
  stopping tobacco use
  drinking within the lower risk alcohol guidelines
  how to support behaviour change


The guidance is the result of a comprehensive review of published research evidence on prevention and draws on a UK wide collaboration of over 100 well respected experts including frontline dental teams and patient representatives.
