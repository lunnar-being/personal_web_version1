In 2011, the Cabinet Office set up an advisory panel of SME owners and entrepreneurs. The small business Advisory Panel provides feedback and challenge to the action the government is taking to remove procurement barriers, and increase its spend with SMEs.

The Panel was refreshed in September 2020 and now has 25 representatives. Appointments are initially for a 12 month period and may be renewed for a further 12 months by agreement of both parties.

Role of Members

The role of the Panel members includes:


  helping identify remaining barriers to small businesses’ success in selling to government and work with government to help remove them
  representing their sectors to help identify specific sectoral issues for small
businesses, and feeding back as appropriate to those sectors
  providing feedback on and constructive criticism of existing and new initiatives
  providing comment on new policy consultations which relate to SMEs
  supporting strategic opportunities for Government to secure better value via
small businesses
  acting where appropriate to communicate the agenda internally and externally
with industry bodies and and within their field.
  advising Ministers on Government’s engagement with small businesses
