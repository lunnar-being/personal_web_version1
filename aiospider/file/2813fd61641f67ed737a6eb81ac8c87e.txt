The Forensic Science Regulator commissions a regular audit of the work of forensic pathologists. These audits have highlighted significant variation in the content and nature of the reports in relation to the ‘history’ section.

The purpose of this document is to provide guidance on the content of the ‘history’ section of the report. This guidance supports the code of practice and performance standards for forensic pathology in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
