This chapter contains provisions that provide a mechanism for the UK and Australia to discuss the impact of innovation on trade. This includes on regulatory approaches, commercialisation of new technologies and supply chain resilience. This will help ensure that the FTA remains fit for purpose as our economies grow.  

This chapter is the first of its kind in any FTA.


The agreement is not yet in force. Both the UK and Australia are required to complete their respective domestic procedures for the agreement to come into effect. Once approved by both parliaments, businesses will be able to trade under its terms.



An accessible version of this document is being created and will be available soon.
