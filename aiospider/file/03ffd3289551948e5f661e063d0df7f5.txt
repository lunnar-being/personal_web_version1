In China, net spending intent has held steady overall; across most categories, it is flat or growing. Consumers continue to shop in stores, but online and omnichannel shopping are dominating some categories, including groceries, pet care, and home improvement. Most consumers report trying new shopping behaviors recently. Openness to change extends to stockouts: roughly half of those shopping for an out-of-stock item have switched product, brand, or retailer to make a purchase. Consumers also modify their behavior in out-of-home activities, enabling more than 80 percent to re-engage in pre-pandemic activities. They say they are excited about the 2021 holidays, intend to spend as much as last year, and plan to shop in stores and online.These exhibits are based on survey data collected in China from October 15 to 22, 2021. Check back for regular updates on Chinese consumer sentiments, behaviors, income, spending, and expectations.
