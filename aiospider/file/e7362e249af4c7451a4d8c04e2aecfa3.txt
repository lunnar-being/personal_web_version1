These are the statutory programmes of study and attainment targets for mathematics at key stages 1 to 4. They are issued by law; you must follow them unless there’s a good reason not to.

All schools maintained by the local authority in England must teach these programmes of study from September 2016.


Schools are not required by law to teach the example content in [square brackets] or the content indicated as being ‘non-statutory’.



At key stage 4, additional content for teaching to higher-attaining pupils is in {braces}.


Short films of teachers and subject experts talking about the national curriculum and how to use it are also available.

Mathematics appendix 1 does not appear in the HTML document but is available as a separate PDF.

Additional resources for recovering teaching following during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic

We have published non-statutory guidance on teaching mathematics in primary schools and at key stage 3. This guidance identifies the core concepts that pupils need to progress, and can help teachers adapt and prioritise their curriculum.

We have also worked with the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics to develop an aligned package of resources, materials and training. This includes, for example, 180 primary maths video lessons and a series of planning to teach secondary maths videos that offer advice on teaching crucial key stage 3 topics.

You can also get help with remote education.
