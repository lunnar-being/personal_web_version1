The U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Fossil Energy has announced up to $2 million in federal funding for cost-shared research and development projects under the funding opportunity announcement (FOA) DE-FOA-0002376, Enabling Gasification of Blended Coal, Biomass, and Plastic Wastes to Produce Hydrogen with Potential for Net-Negative Carbon Dioxide Emissions.This FOA seeks applications for the research and development of the co-gasification of coal with biomass and plastic wastes. The aim is to advance net-negative carbon technologies that can produce hydrogen or other high-value fuels, either as the sole product or as a co-product. Like coal, waste plastics are ideal feedstocks to blend with biomass due to their extremely high volatile matter and low moisture and ash content. As a result, the development of co-gasification technologies sought in this FOA will help alleviate concerns over potential feedstock availability and other operational issues.The FOA focuses on one area of interest:  Projects that fall under this area of interest will concentrate on gasification to utilize coal, biomass, and plastic waste feedstocks to improve the cost, performance, reliability, and flexibility of net-negative carbon- emitting polygeneration technologies that will produce hydrogen and other hydrogen-based fuels.Applications must be submitted by November 22, 2020.
