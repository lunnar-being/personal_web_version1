What ‘negligible value’ means

For tax purposes there is no accepted definition of ‘negligible value’, but generally it applies to assets that have become worth next to nothing while someone has owned them.

Assets cannot have been of negligible value when you acquired them, they must have become of negligible value while you have owned them.

How to make a negligible value claim

If you can give evidence to HMRC that shows that your assets no longer have any value since you acquired them, you may be able to make a negligible value claim. You can use this to realise a loss to reduce your Capital Gains Tax liability.

Make a claim by either:


  writing to your tax office
  entering a negligible value on your tax return


Your tax office may ask the Shares and Assets Valuation team to consider your claim.

Negligible value claims for company shares and securities

If the company is in liquidation or receivership

You’ll need to give the following information:


  a statement of affairs for the company and any subsidiaries
  a letter from the liquidator or receiver showing whether any return will be made to the shareholders
  details of how this decision was reached (for example, a balance sheet showing significantly more debts than assets)
  any evidence that no recovery or rescue of the company is likely (for example, a statement that the company has ceased trading)


If the company is not in liquidation or receivership

You’ll need to give full and comprehensive information that shows that the shares or securities have become of negligible value.

Negligible value agreements and claims for previously quoted companies

HMRC publishes a list of shares and securities in companies that were previously quoted on the London Stock Exchange and that have been accepted as being of negligible value.

You can use it to find shares which have been declared as being worth negligible value up to 30 November 2021.

You’ll still have to submit your claim to HMRC if you own shares or securities for a company shown on the list.

A list is not published for:


  unquoted companies
  companies formerly quoted on the Alternative Investment Market and PLUS Market
  non-UK companies


How to use the Negligible Value Agreement list

To check if your shares or securities were quoted on the London Stock Exchange, and have been declared as being of negligible value, select the first letter of the company name in the Negligible Value Agreement list index.

The word ‘security’ represents the ownership interest held by the shareholders in a company, realised in the form of publicly traded stock or shares which includes ordinary shares and preferred stock.

The ‘effective date’ is the date that an agreement or transaction becomes binding, that is the date (or length of time) on which a claim to Negligible Value on the shown security is valid.

The ‘dissolved date’ is the date the company ceased to legally exist. You cannot make a negligible value claim on or after the date the company has been dissolved.
