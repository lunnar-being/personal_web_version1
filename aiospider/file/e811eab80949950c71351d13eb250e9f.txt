The countervailing duty on bus and lorry tyres from China was imposed by the EU on behalf of the UK and the other member states. The Secretary of State for International Trade transitioned the countervailing duty to continue applying in the UK after the transition period.

A transition review of the countervailing duty will be initiated before 13 November 2023.
