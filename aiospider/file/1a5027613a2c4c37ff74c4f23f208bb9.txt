The IGB project delivered efficient laboratory and office space for 300 scientists near other bioscience activities on the Berkeley Lab campus.“The co-location of JGI and KBase with other biosciences-related research activities advances the SC [Office of Science] mission,” said Hemant Patel, IGB federal project manager.Patel said scientists will use IGB to study plant and microbe interactions important to improving biofuel feedstocks, understanding greenhouse gas fluxes, and other energy and environmental research.IGB is itself environmentally sustainable. The building is 31 percent better than the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers standard.The project team overcame challenges such as rising construction costs to finish on budget and 10 months ahead of schedule in February 2020.The Materials Design Laboratory (MDL) at Argonne National Laboratory supports the entire life cycle of energy-related materials research. Research there will range from theory and simulation to application of new materials and processes.“The MDL is a flexible state-of-the-art science laboratory facility, housing a variety of highly specialized labs,” said Jurgis (George) Paliulionis, the MDL federal project director.The four-story building contains radiological, vibration-sensitive, and wet chemistry laboratories. It also includes office and meeting space for 100 researchers and staff. The Chicago Building Congress recognized the MDL with its 2020 Merit Award in the “Commercial Construction Over $50M” category. The American Concrete Institute Illinois Chapter for Excellence in Concrete Construction also awarded the MDL in its “Mid-Rise Buildings” category.Some of MDL’s sustainable design features include high-efficiency lighting, efficient heating and cooling systems, recycled materials, and electric vehicle charging stations. The project team completed the project on budget and 16 months ahead of schedule in December 2019. The Office of Science is the single largest supporter of basic research in the physical sciences in the United States and is working to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time.
