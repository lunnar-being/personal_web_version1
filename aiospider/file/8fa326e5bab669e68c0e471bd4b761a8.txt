Most financial decision makers in Malaysia view the current economy as neutral or weak and many expect their personal financial situations to remain the same or worsen in the next three months. Slightly less than half of consumers are concerned about their job security and have four months or fewer in savings to live off. Most feel banks are performing per their expectations and would like them to allow more flexibility in loan payments. Contactless payments have seen increased usage over the past month, while check and credit card usage has decreased. Consumers are more optimistic about future economic conditions than last month, with 45% believing the economy will rebound within 2-3 months.
