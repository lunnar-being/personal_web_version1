Information on the socio-economic work being carried out by Dounreay and the funding available.

Details

The closure of Dounreay will result in major social and economic challenges for the area. Managing the impact on the local area is therefore important to the site. By 2030 to 2033 only a handful of jobs will remain on the site. A significant number of the current workforce will need alternative employment after Dounreay.

The Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership (CNSRP) is an informal partnership of the main public sector bodies with a remit to address the socio-economic effects of decommissioning Dounreay.

The partners are:


  Dounreay
  Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP)
  Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA)
  Highlands and Islands Enterprise
  The Highland Council
  Caithness Chamber of Commerce
  Skills Development Scotland
  The Scottish Government


For further information see the CNSRP website.

In delivering the Dounreay decommissioning programme

NDA spends up to £200 million a year to decommission the site. A significant part of this is spent in the local economy through salaries and the purchase of goods and services.

Dounreay employs around 1,000 staff and a similar number of individuals through the supply chain.
It is estimated that over £125m of goods and services are purchased annually, and a significant amount of this expenditure is with companies within Caithness and north Sutherland.

The Energy Act 2004 requires the NDA to consider the socio economic impacts of decommissioning on local communities. Dounreay and CDP have contractual obligations with the NDA to support the delivery of socio economic activities.

Resources

NDA, CDP and Dounreay work closely together as the Dounreay Socio Economic Alliance (DSEA). The aim is to align our activities with CNSRP, to maximise the combined resources and ensure a consistent approach to reduce the impact of decommissioning Dounreay.

CNSRP aims to support ventures by looking at the future opportunities for an economy post Dounreay.

Those directly involved in socio economic activities are:


  NDA - stakeholder relations and socio economic manager
  CDP - business support consultant with socio economic support
  Dounreay - socio economic manager with socio economic support
*Additional individuals/groups may undertake agreed activities (e.g. secondments to organisations)


The interventions provided by the DSEA to reduce the impact of decommissioning Dounreay are:


  Capital funding
  Revenue funding
  People
  A combination of the above


In addition to direct NDA socio economic funding, £500,000 is allocated from the Dounreay annual budget for socio economic assistance.

NDA and Dounreay direct funding

Details of the NDA funding for socio economic projects can be found on the NDA website

Grant funding guidance can be found on the [NDA website] (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/one-nda-local-social-and-economic-impact-practitioners-guidance-grant-funding)
