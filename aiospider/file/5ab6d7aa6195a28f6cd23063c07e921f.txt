Award Number: DE-EE0009354CX(s) Applied: A9, A11Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): AZOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to Arizona State University to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to develop an algorithm that would detect and classify anomalies, predict failures, and schedule maintenance activities at photovoltaic (PV) power plants. Using data collected from solar plants at Arizona State University and Arizona Public Service, this algorithm would be used to develop software modules and tutorials that would optimize operation and maintenance of PV power plants.
