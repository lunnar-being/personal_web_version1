Three teams that have received David Packard Excellence in Acquisition awards are helping ensure that future defense secretaries will continue to lead the finest fighting force the world has ever known, Defense Secretary Ash Carter said here today.The Packard award is the department’s premier acquisition award that recognizes organizations and teams whose programs have achieved acquisition excellence, efficiency and productivity.“Our 2015 Packard Award recipients have done some pretty amazing things,” Carter said, and described the teams’ achievements.The Space-Based Infrared System Geostationary Earth Orbit 5/6 team saved more than $1 billion in purchasing and modernizing satellites that are critical to U.S. protection from strategic and theater ballistic missile threats, he said.The Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar team replaced five legacy radar systems with a single solution that better protects Marines in the field, while saving more than $334 million, the secretary said.And the Joint Program Office’s Joint Light Tactical Vehicles team is delivering tactical vehicles strong enough to meet the Army’s protection requirements and the Marine Corps’ mobility requirements, he said.Carter said he also was honored to recognize the two recipients of the Should-Cost and Innovation Award.“Should cost is a term I coined with Frank [Kendall] … as a way of highlighting the importance for all program managers –- on the government and industry teams -– to understand thoroughly every single item and … to make sure they know what each part should cost,” the secretary explained.By doing so, he added, the 2015 Should-Cost Award recipients have saved a tremendous amount of money for the taxpayer.The Air Force Materiel Command’s Armament Directorate saved $694 million while equipping U.S. warfighters with war-winning airpower capabilities, Carter said.“They’ve fostered a culture for a 1,800-person organization in which an innovative idea from one program can now be immediately shared and replicated across 83 other programs,” he added.And the E-2/C-2 Airborne Tactical Data System Program Office built a software platform in its spare time to manage should-cost initiatives for products that extend the Navy’s eyes, ears and logistics capabilities. “Through this tool,” Carter said, “they’ve secured $500 million in savings, with the added benefit of creating the capability to dial out obsolescence before it happens.”Near the end of the ceremony, Carter thanked all the teams in the audience.“Thanks for your professionalism, your dedication to our warfighters and our taxpayers, and for your inspirational ingenuity in delivering superior products at better prices -- that’s what it’s all about,” he added.
