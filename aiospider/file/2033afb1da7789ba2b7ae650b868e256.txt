In this capacity, OMB oversees agency management of programs and resources to achieve legislative goals and Administration policy. It also oversees agency program evaluation activities to determine their net effects, success or failure, and how agencies respond to these findings by making management improvements and developing new budget and policy proposals. 





OMB’s Management Offices include:

The Office of E-Government and Information Technology (E-Gov)
, headed by the Federal Government’s Chief Information Officer, develops and provides direction in the use of technologyInternet-based technologies to make it easier for citizens and businesses to interact with the Federal Government, save taxpayer dollars, and streamline citizen participation. 





The Office of Performance and Personnel Management (OPPM)
 
leads the effort to drive mission-focused performance gains across the Federal government.  OPPM coordinates the Administration’s goal-setting and performance review process for agencies’ high priority performance goals and guides agency strategic and annual planning, performance reviews and performance reporting.  OPPM also functions as the Resource Management Office for the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and guides Federal personnel policy, working closely with OPM to implement effective personnel policies and practices.
