The CMA’s work throughout the pandemic has focused on protecting customers and fair-dealing businesses. During the course of the review of the PCR travel test market, the CMA found that travellers do not have the means to find the best deals and are at risk from providers who breach consumer law. The advice to the UK Government contains eight recommendations that together, we think will produce better outcomes in the market for PCR travel testing.
