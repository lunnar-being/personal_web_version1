This guidance explains how the UK’s Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) investigates possible cases of dumped and subsidised imports and unforeseen surges in imports (known as safeguards investigations).

We can then determine whether a new trade remedy measure is needed to protect UK industries.
We are also carrying out transition reviews into current EU trade remedy measures which are relevant to UK industries.

This guidance explains our investigations process, how to apply to us to open a new investigation and how we assess injury to UK industries from imports. You can also find out how we will apply the Economic Interest Test which assesses whether a new trade remedy measure is in the UK’s economic interest.

You can create an account and register your interest in UK trade remedy investigations and reviews on the Trade Remedies Service. You can also submit an application for a new investigation and view active cases and reviews on our public file.

This is the first version of our operational guidance and we actively encourage feedback from interested groups and individuals. You can email us with any comments or questions at contact@traderemedies.gov.uk.
