As demand for energy storage continues to grow and evolve, it is critical to compare the costs and performance of different energy storage technologies on an equitable basis. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory’s  provides a range of cost estimates for technologies in 2020 and 2030 as well as a framework to help break down different cost categories of energy storage systems. The analysis is accompanied by an  that makes updated energy storage cost and performance data easily accessible for the stakeholder community.Download the .
