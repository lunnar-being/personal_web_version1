Award Number: DE-EE0009255CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.1, B3.6Geothermal Technologies OfficeLocation(s): NYOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to Cornell University (‘Cornell’) for a practical working demonstration project that would enact and test the recommendations of a prior geothermal energy feasibility report (prepared under DOE award number DE-EE0008103) by drilling an exploratory borehole on-campus in Ithaca, NY. The purpose of the proposed project is to collect data to verify regional subsurface conditions and quantify the costs and benefits of using deep direct-use geothermal heat to meet a percentage of Cornell’s annual campus heating demand.
