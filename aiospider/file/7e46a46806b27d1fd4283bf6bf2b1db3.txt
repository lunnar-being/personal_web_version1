Richard Zeckhauser and Joseph AldyHumanity is its own enemy in the war against the warming of our planet. To our peril, policymakers have ignored a deep insight  to Sun Tzu, from the fifth century B.C. Chinese military treatise, : “Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.”Environmental advocates, major international environmental agreements, and domestic policy programs have traditionally focused on a myopic one-prong tactic to fighting climate change. That prong is , the curbing of emissions. A better, well-crafted strategy to address the risks posed by climate change, however, would engage three prongs: continuing mitigation, while adding  and  to the armamentarium.Were Sun Tzu writing on climate change today, he might describe the mitigation-only approach by invoking the metaphor of fighting a modern war relying solely on ground forces, while ignoring what air and naval forces could contribute. Consistent with his approach to war, he would likely support investments in adaptation and resilience to  some of the damages associated with warmer temperatures. He would also  research into solar radiation management—such as injecting aerosols into the upper atmosphere to reflect back incoming solar energy—to lower the temperature for a given accumulation of atmospheric greenhouse gases....
