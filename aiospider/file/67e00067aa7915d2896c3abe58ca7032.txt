Award Number: DE-EE0009027CX(s) Applied: A9, B5.15Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): CAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy is proposing to provide federal funding to San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E) for the addition of advanced grid-forming inverters and other control features to the Borrego Springs Microgrid (San Diego County, CA) in order to field validate new microgrid technologies. Specifically, the project would be focused on developing and deploying algorithms that enable distributed energy resources (DERs) to contribute to grid stability and resilience by establishing frequency and maintaining voltage magnitude during transient conditions, especially during microgrid islanding.
