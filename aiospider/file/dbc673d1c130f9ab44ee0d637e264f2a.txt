Internet filing enabled software and online forms are available from HMRC and commercial software suppliers. These can be used to file CIS monthly returns (CIS300) and make verification requests.

HMRC accepts forms and returns filed using any of the products listed in this document.

We provide a free product, ‘Online Tax Return - CIS’ that lets you file monthly returns (CIS300) online. Register for the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) online service to get access to the product.

HMRC has tested all the features of this service. If you need help or support, contact the Online Services Helpdesk.
