Award Number: DE-EE0008922CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Bioenergy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): CAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Vertimass to convert jet fuel aromatics into cycloalkanes using cellulosic ethanol and fusel oil feedstocks (Note: fusel oils are hydrocarbons with a high molecular weight). The project would seek to optimize a process previously developed by Vertimass for hydrocarbon conversion from ethanol. The project would focus on optimization of the conversion catalyst and energy density, as well as a reduction in particulate emissions associated with combustion.
