As organizations  amid the COVID-19 crisis, a key part of their strategy should be to revise total rewards to reflect changes to both financial and non-financial incentives. Non-financial rewards will become increasingly significant as organizations seek to retain talent with flexibility in a post-COVID workplace. Total rewards have also taken on increasing importance given the cultural context and conversation around equity. The current disruption provides a unique opportunity for organizations to holistically rethink their total rewards philosophy. A total rewards package can include fixed pay, variable pay, annual cash bonus, and long-term wealth creation through various incentives. It also covers benefits like health and retirement, non-cash compensation like transportation or educational stipends, and non-financial rewards like training, flexibility programs, and leave. More importantly, total rewards is the strategy and set of principles that govern these offerings—the “why” behind the “what.” Organizations must demonstrate that they have structured their rewards fairly by transparently communicating the link among business performance, individual performance, and rewards. While our focus here is on salaried employees, the same principles apply for hourly non-exempt workers. Our research and experience in transforming major organizations’ performance management highlights three guiding principles for designing a total rewards philosophy. Organizations should also determine how much discretion managers have in determining rewards. A formulaic approach helps to eliminate bias and enable transparency, but takes power away from the manager. Organizations that keep these principles in mind while designing and implementing total rewards will be better positioned to attract and retain top talent in a workforce that is increasingly demanding flexibility and equity.
