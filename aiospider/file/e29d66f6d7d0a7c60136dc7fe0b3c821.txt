request for information (RFI)
, available today and open for 30 days from its official date of publication on Monday, will inform the Task Force’s recommendations to ensure robust and accurate evidence-based policymaking and to restore public trust in government.





Established in May, the nearly 50-member Scientific Integrity Task Force, representing agencies from across the Federal government, regularly convenes to respond to President Biden’s January memorandum on 
Restoring Trust in Government Through Scientific Integrity and Evidence-Based Policymaking
. The Task Force is reviewing existing Federal scientific-integrity policies to identify effective solutions that will help Federal science improve the lives of the American people, inform innovative and equitable policy, and revitalize the confidence of the American public in its government.





“We need all of America to help protect scientific integrity and restore public trust,” 
said OSTP Deputy Director for Science and Society Alondra Nelson
. “Our public call urges Americans from across the country to help chart the course for fact-based policymaking for years to come. Together, we can tackle our most pressing challenges with solutions that are informed by science.”





During its most recent meetings, the Task Force established working groups to examine instances in which scientific integrity policies were not followed or enforced and identify effective practices for ensuring integrity in emerging areas of scientific and technological research and analysis, improving training in scientific integrity, bolstering research transparency, and protecting science communication. In addition, given the importance of scientific integrity as a foundation for trust in government, the Task Force formed a working group to coordinate external engagement—to gather feedback from a range of stakeholders, including the American public, through a range of interactions and channels for input, including upcoming listening sessions and the RFI announced today.
