This guidance aims to help you to:


  communicate using inclusive language and know which words to use and avoid when writing about disability
  include disabled people in your communications and campaigns and make sure that they’re portrayed positively and realistically
  make sure your communications are accessible
  choose and use appropriate communication channels to reach disabled people


There are over 11 million people with a long term illness, impairment or disability in Great Britain. Communicators must be confident their messages will reach everyone, including disabled people. This can be done by ensuring all communications are inclusive and accessible.

The Office for Disability Issues wrote this guidance for government communicators but it may also be useful to others.

Accessible communications online

You can also read guidance from the Government Digital Service on:


  making your public sector website or app accessible
  publishing accessible documents
