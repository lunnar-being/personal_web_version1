The University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW), proposes to develop, evaluate, and competitively benchmark various surface peening technologies and associated hybrid surface engineering approaches to mitigate initiation and growth of chloride-induced stress corrosion cracking (CISCC) in manufactured stainless-steel canisters and in-service canisters for used nuclear fuel dry cask storage systems (DSCC).
