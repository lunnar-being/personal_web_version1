Award Number: DE-EE0008971CX(s) Applied: A9, B1.31, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): MAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Leading Edge Crystal Technologies (LECT) to develop a novel process for the production of silicon wafers. Specifically, LECT would use a crystalgrowth process, the Float Silicon Method, to produce silicon wafers. A silicon crystal growth furnace would be developed and commissioned for use in the project. The project would be completed over three Budget Periods (BPs), with a Go/No-Go Decision point in between each BP.
