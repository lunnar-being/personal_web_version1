Award Number: DE-EE0008916CX(s) Applied: A9, B1.31, B3.6Bioenergy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): FLOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to T2C-Energy to further develop and test a mobile “bolt-on” biogas conversion technology (TRIFTS® technology). The technology was initially designed as part of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program (2016-17). The upgraded unit would use novel catalyst technologies to convert various biogas feedstocks (e.g. wastewater, food waste, animal waste, etc.) to liquid transportation fuels. This project would seek to de-risk and optimize the existing technology, enable detailed performance analysis/cost projections, and prepare the technology for future full-scale demonstration.
