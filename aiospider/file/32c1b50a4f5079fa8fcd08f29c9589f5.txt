Trent Dillon, a current fellow in the Marine and Hydrokinetic Graduate Student Research Program, is studying the potential benefits of harnessing wave energy to improve coastal resilience for the Makah Tribe, whose land is situated on the northwest corner of the Olympic Peninsula. During his internship, Trent had the opportunity to stand on top of a wind turbine more than 250 feet above the ground at NREL’s National Wind Technology Center. Scientists in Hawaii use energy from waves and sunlight to power a recording device and listen to whales. The renewable energy-powered “Wave Gliders” allow scientists to gather information at sea without harming the whales and the surrounding environment.
