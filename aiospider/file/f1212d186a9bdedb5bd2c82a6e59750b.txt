This guidance has been produced by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) to assist the longlisted places successful in the expression of interest (EOI) phase of the 2025 UK City of Culture competition to submit their full applications.

UK City of Culture is a UK-wide programme, developed in collaboration with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The competition is run by DCMS, inviting places across the UK to set out their vision for culture-led regeneration every four years. Derry/Londonderry was the inaugural UK City of Culture in 2013 and the competition is now a permanent fixture in the UKâ€™s cultural calendar.
