The Office of Management and Budget oversees the implementation of the President’s vision across the Executive Branch. OMB carries out its mission through five main functions across executive departments and agencies:





Budget development and execution;
Management, including oversight of agency performance, procurement, financial management, and information technology;
Coordination and review of all significant Federal regulations from executive agencies, privacy policy, information policy, and review and assessment of information collection requests; and
Clearance and coordination of legislative and other materials, including agency testimony, legislative proposals, and other communications with Congress, and coordination of other Presidential actions.
Clearance of Presidential Executive Orders and memoranda to agency heads prior to their issuance.
