The budget also reflects some of the tough choices the department has had to make, including lessening reliance on vulnerable systems, she said.Savings from divesting in those systems will be reallocated to fund research and development in enabling technologies like cyber, long-range fires, microelectronics, offensive and defensive hypersonic systems, artificial intelligence and quantum science, Hicks said.
This budget includes the largest ever research development test and evaluation request at $112 billion, which includes $14.7 billion for science and technology, she said.Investments also focus on U.S. manufacturing and innovation, especially in underrepresented populations and with small businesses, Hicks said.




Investing in people is also high on the list of department priorities, she said. "We prioritize growing our talent by providing pay raises for both military and civilian personnel, and we seek to make investments in the workforce where the department has critical demands, like cyber. The FY22 request also looks to build an increasingly resilient force, one that recognizes and embraces its diversity as a strength."Hicks said another investment in people includes providing funding for the military health system and $8.6 billion for  programs.
Other budget priorities include , rooting out insider threats and extremism in the ranks, addressing , building energy saving platforms and diverse power sources, and defeating COVID-19, she said.
