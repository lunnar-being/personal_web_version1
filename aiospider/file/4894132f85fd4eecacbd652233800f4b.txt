Technology, Innovation, and Data Science Research

From big data analysis and blockchain to STEM education and cyber security, the exploration of policies that affect innovation and emerging technology is a popular focus at Pardee RAND. Students frequently make substantive contributions through RAND research projects, experiential learning in the Tech + Narrative Lab, and their own dissertation research. Pardee RAND is also a founding partner in the Public Interest Technology University Network.Student-Faculty Research Collaborations
Through project-based research and other experiential learning opportunities, students work with faculty mentors to obtain professional skills and tacit knowledge that courses alone cannot convey. Here are a few recent projects and their resulting research.
