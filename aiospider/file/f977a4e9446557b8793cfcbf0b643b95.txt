Did you know that November 8 was National STEM Day? Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, commonly known as STEM, are the essential building blocks to accomplishing the U.S. Department of Energy Water Power Technologies Office’s (WPTO’s) mission to advance hydropower and marine and hydrokinetic (MHK) technologies. In honor of this day, we are highlighting some recent WPTO-related STEM announcements. We encourage you to celebrate this day by learning more and getting involved.  Through these STEM activities, we hope to provide our future workforce with the tools and opportunities to ensure hydropower and marine energy technologies can help serve U.S. energy needs well into the future.
