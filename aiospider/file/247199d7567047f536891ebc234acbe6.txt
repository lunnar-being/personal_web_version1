Award Number: DE-EE0008732CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6, B3.16Wind Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): WAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to SMRU Consulting to develop technology to validate acoustic noise modelling and monitor exclusion zones for North Atlantic right whales (NARW) during offshore wind construction (with an emphasis on pile driving). The objective of the proposed project is to develop a costeffective and robust system for monitoring and mitigating U.S. offshore wind construction through the use of a Coastal Acoustic Buoy (CAB).
