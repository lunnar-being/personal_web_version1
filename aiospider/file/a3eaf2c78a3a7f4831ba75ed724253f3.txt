Award Number: DE-EE0008972CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6, B3.15Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): NYOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Energy Materials Corporation (EMC) to develop a solar photovoltaic (PV) mini-module that would incorporate new technologies and manufacturing processes that would allow for increased performance efficiency, as compared to the current state of the technology. As part of the project, EMC would design, fabricate, and test perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and prototype mini-modules, incorporating the new technologies and processes.
