The Debt Management Vulnerability Toolkit is designed to help public sector creditors support their vulnerable customers. It provides front line staff with best-practice tools to identify and assist people facing physical and mental challenges, so recovery can focus on those who are deliberately trying to avoid repaying their debts.

The toolkit has been collaboratively developed by the governmentâ€™s Debt Fairness Group, a partnership between central and local government, the debt advice sector, and the debt collection industry. These proven best-practice tools can ensure that government continues to provide the best possible support to individuals in vulnerable circumstances, and build on the successes the adoption of these tools has brought in other creditor sectors.
