Award Number: DE-EE0009070CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Building Technologies OfficeLocation(s): INOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to University of Notre Dame to investigate the behavior of reinforced 3-D printed concrete walls with integrated thermal insulation. A suite of samples with different construction and insulation methods would be printed and tested for thermal and structural behavior. Recommendations would be made for insulating methods and structural designs of thermally efficient 3D-printed walls.
