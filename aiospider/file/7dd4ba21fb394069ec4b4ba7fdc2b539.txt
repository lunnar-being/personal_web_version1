Award Number: DE-EE0009355CX(s) Applied: A9Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): AZOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to Arizona State University (ASU) to develop machine learning frameworks to process raw data from integrated solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. As part of the project, existing data would be used to develop machine learning algorithms and model their application in simulated environments. The project would be completed over three Budget Periods (BPs), with a Go/No-Go Decision Point in between each BP.
