The project will evaluate how a combination of new materials, additive manufacturing technologies, and airfoil cooling design can raise the efficiency of turbines used in CHP systems by demonstrating how to increase the turbine firing temperature by 100Â°C compared to a 2015 baseline. The project team will also estimate the economic benefits from these efficiency gains in CHP systems that use turbines smaller than 20 MW.
