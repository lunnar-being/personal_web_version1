This page provides further information about what the Global Human Rights sanctions regime aims to do and what it covers. It also explains the information needed when the UK government considers those who may be designated under this regime.  A ‘designated person’ is an individual or organisation who has been listed under a sanctions regime and is therefore subject to sanctions measures.

It aims to inform those who may wish to submit information to the government about specific designations.
