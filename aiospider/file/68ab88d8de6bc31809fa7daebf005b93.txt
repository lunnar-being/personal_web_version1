The stove would be developed with software to limit emissions levels, regardless of the loading method used. Pilot versions of the stove would be developed and tested in laboratory settings. Units would then be developed for consumer testing, incorporating the results from previous performance tests. Consumer testing would be undertaken for a period of 4 â€“ 6 months.
