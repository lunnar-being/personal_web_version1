Award Number: DE-EE0008680CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.2, B3.6Building Technologies OfficeLocation(s): GAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) to develop, demonstrate, and test a novel system to produce building energy models for evaluation of existing building envelopes (e.g. outdoor envelope energy audits). The system, AirBEM, would utilize an unmanned aerial vehicle to collect data (e.g. heat transfer data and envelope material conditions) on newly constructed building envelopes, via an attached infrared camera.
