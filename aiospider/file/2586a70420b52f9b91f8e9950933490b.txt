Following the London 2018 Commonwealth Cyber Declaration, the UK government implemented a series of projects to help Commonwealth countries improve their cyber security capacity.

This guidance aims to help Commonwealth countries understand  national Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) development frameworks that are available and may be suitable as a primary source of good practice guidance. The guide includes material that has been presented and discussed over the course of 4 workshops, as well as further guidance and links to additional nCSIRT development material.

The Guide is a reference document for the participating Commonwealth countries to use as a:


  record of the nCSIRT workshop learning points and materials used
  library for further resources that can assist them in further developing their national CSIRT
