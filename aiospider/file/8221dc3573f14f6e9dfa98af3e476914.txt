Most financial decision makers in Russia view the current economy as neutral or weak, and 40 percent believe it will worsen in the next 3 months (down from almost 70 percent in April). Similarly, most also expect their personal financial situations to remain the same or worsen in the next three months. Slightly more than one third of consumers are concerned about job security, but two thirds have less than 4 months of savings to live off. Most consumers feel banks are performing per their expectations, though satisfaction is net negative, and many would like banks to waive late fees.
