The U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), with funding from DOE’s Wind Energy Technologies Office, works with dozens of small business across the United States to advance  through the Competitiveness Improvement Project (CIP). Today, DOE announces eight new CIP projects that will make distributed wind energy more cost competitive, improve its interoperability with other distributed energy resources, and increase the number of small and mid-scale wind turbine designs certified to national testing standards.Launched in 2013, the  supports manufacturers of distributed wind technology—typically small and medium scale wind turbines—through competitively-awarded, cost-shared projects aiming to: 1) optimize designs for increased energy production and grid support; 2) test turbines and components to national standards to verify performance and safety; and 3) develop advanced manufacturing processes to reduce hardware costs. Beyond funding support, awardees can receive technical assistance from NREL to improve their turbine designs and testing plans. Since 2013, NREL has awarded 36 subcontracts to 20 companies, totaling $7.75 million of funding, while leveraging $3.79 million in additional private-sector investment. Today’s selections add $2.6 million in DOE funding, bringing the total DOE commitment to over $10 million, and leveraging over $5 million in industry cost-share."The Competitiveness Improvement Project has advanced the state of distributed wind technology in the United States, reducing the cost of some designs by more than 50%. CIP also supports the electrical, performance, and safety certifications of next-generation technologies, which is important for competitive market entry and export," said Daniel Simmons, Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy at DOE.The projects selected through  continue the trends of developing turbines with larger rotors and advanced controls integrated with energy storage.Mirroring a trend seen with larger wind turbines, most of these projects are developing small or medium-size wind turbines with longer blades and larger rotors, allowing them to capture more energy even in areas with lower wind speeds. These larger rotors create a need to reconsider the drive trains, turbine controls, and support structures, not only to increase energy production, but also manage loads and reduce system weight and cost.Several of these projects will work to integrate energy storage with their systems in order to provide grid support services and resiliency. A critical component for integrating energy storage is the power converter. Two projects will build on recent work funded under the CIP to develop and manufacture a modular, high efficiency wind-specific power converter that will be compatible with a variety of wind turbines.The  supports  in alignment with the Office’s goals to make wind energy cost competitive, improve interoperability with other distributed energy resources, and increase the number of wind turbine designs certified to national testing standards.
