Award Number: DE-EE0008911CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6,Bioenergy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): GAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to the University of Georgia Research Foundation (University of Georgia – ‘UGA’) to develop non-destructive imaging and machine learning tools to analyze targeted biomass properties, including chemical composition, conversion performance, and handling performance. Southern pine forest residues (SPFR) and corn stover would be collected, separated, and analyzed in laboratory settings using the tools developed as part of the project. Data acquired from assessments would be used to train machine learning algorithms.
