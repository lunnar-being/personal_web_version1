Land and buildings collection tool (LBCT) 2021

The LBCT for 2021 is now closed. It will go live again in autumn 2022.

Academy land and buildings collection tool workbook

The workbook will show you all the data fields in the LBCT form and can be used to help you prepare for this return.

You can tailor the Excel workbook to suit your own circumstances by deleting sections that aren’t relevant. If you have used the workbook last year you won’t need to complete another.


Please note that we will not accept the workbook as a submission, we will only accept returns made via the online form.
