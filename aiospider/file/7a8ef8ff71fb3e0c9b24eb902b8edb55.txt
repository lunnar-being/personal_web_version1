Award Number: DE-EE0008152CX(s) Applied: A9, B1.31, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): MAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to BrightSpot Automation LLC to conduct a fundamental study on the nature of cracked cells in crystalline silicon solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and develop more durable modules in which the cells are less likely to crack or, if cracks do occur, less likely to contribute to power loss. The anticipated outcome would be a set of improved panel designs and materials, prototype advanced module manufacturing equipment, and recommendations for improvements to module certification tests and testing specifications.
