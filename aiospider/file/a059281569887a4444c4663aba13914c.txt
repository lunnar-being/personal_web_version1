Award Number: DE-EE0009236CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Fuel Cell Technologies OfficeLocation(s): NYOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Plug Power, Inc to design, develop, and fabricate Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM)-based electrolyzer stack cell components. The project would develop a single-piece Integrated Membrane Anode Assembly (IMAA), a single-piece anode-support-structure (SPASS) coated with catalysts and ionomers on one side, to be used in place of the two separate components that make up a PEM-based electrolyzer stack: the membrane-electrode-assembly (MEA) and the anode-support-structure. The project would be completed over three Budget Periods (BPs) with a Go/No-Go Decision Point between each BP.
