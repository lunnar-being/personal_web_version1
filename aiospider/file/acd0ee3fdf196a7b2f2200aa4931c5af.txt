In 2019, the UK became the first major economy to adopt a legal commitment to achieve ‘Net Zero’ carbon emissions by 2050. To support this, the Government Commercial Function has developed a new commercial policy measure for all central government departments and arm’s length bodies.

This measure requires suppliers bidding for major government contracts to commit to achieving Net Zero by 2050 and publish a ‘Carbon Reduction Plan’.
