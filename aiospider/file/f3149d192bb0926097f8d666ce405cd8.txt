We are pleased to announce that we are accepting applications for the 2021 Faculty Leaders Program in Policy Research and Analysis.  The sessions will all be virtual, with three days of intensive programming July 19-21, followed by three one-on-one mentoring sessions and time to work on a policy project, and group meetings on July 28 and August 6.
Applications are due Tuesday, March 23, 2021.How to apply
Through the Next Generation Initiative’s Faculty Leaders Program, the Pardee RAND Graduate School seeks to build diversity in public policy through strong engagement of faculty leaders across the United States, and in particular at colleges and universities serving students underrepresented in public policy.
Faculty Leader Fellowships are awarded to 12–16 selected faculty to participate in a week-long policy analysis summer program organized and led by the Pardee RAND Graduate School. 

“We were able to engage actively in the learning process by participating in sessions that fostered critical thinking, analytical reasoning, complex problem-solving, and multidisciplinary collaborative research planning.”

As the Pardee RAND Graduate School trains graduates who will develop public policy in this country and around the world, we are committed to help ensure that a diversity of voices and perspectives are an integral part of the policymaking process. Part of that commitment is drawing that diversity into public policy education to create the next generation of leaders with a range of voices and perspectives.
The program is designed to have a number of facets: 
	a “short course” in the methods of policy analysis modeled after the curriculum of our doctoral program
	an opportunity for each participant to apply these tools to a policy issue of their choice with mentorship and input from RAND policy researchers in areas of common interest
	an introduction to the Pardee RAND Graduate School, its faculty and advanced doctoral fellows in policy analysis
	a forum in which to network with each other and past participants in the program
The intent is for participating faculty to return to their home institutions armed with new tools to effect change in their communities and to inspire their students to consider careers and advanced study in public policy analysis.
This year's participants will work with their assigned mentors on a policy project of their choosing. Final products may include:

Op-Ed/Commentary
Grant proposal/research aims
Developing new course or modifing existing course to bring in policy elements (learning objectives, readings, classroom discussions & activities)
Manuscript (e.g., journal article, book chapter)
Research plan (e.g., methodology, policy framework)
Community engagement effort (e.g., community presentation; community based participatory research methodology, stakeholder engagement plan)


The 2021 program is structured as a virtual series of workshops July 19-21, July 28, and August 6. We anticipate that the 2022 program will be held in person in Santa Monica, CA.

The Next Generation Initiative
 Pardee RAND created the Next Generation Initiative to broaden the perspectives within, and the resources for, the next generation of policy leaders. Through education and training in policy analysis and research; building relationships across institutions, disciplines, academic researchers, policy analysts, and students; and developing direct ties with the communities affected by public policy, the Next Generation Initiative will prepare a cadre of policy analysts, innovators, and leaders who can tackle the most challenging societal and public problems in their communities, nationally, and internationally, from perspectives that are as informed as they are diverse.
Support for the Faculty Leaders Program
The 2018-2019 Faculty Leaders Program was generously supported by the Henry Luce Foundation.
