Science and innovation underpin the economies of both Bahrain and the UK. Encouraging work between the two countries therefore produces benefits for both.

Science and innovation are at the heart of government strategy for promoting prosperity and growth. Research and knowledge is increasingly developed and transferred through international collaboration which provides opportunities to work with the best in the world, exchange students and researchers, and gain access to large scale international facilities; leading to mutual benefits for the UK and Bahrain.

Responsibilities
The Science and Innovation Network (SIN) has more than 100 officers in over 40 countries and territories around the world building partnerships and collaborations on science and innovation.

In Bahrain, SIN are working on the following global objectives:


  Establishing the UK as Bahrain’s pivotal partner of choice in science and innovation.
  Supporting the Bahrain in enhancing their resilience and security by addressing long-term threats, including emerging health issues and global challenges on water and food security, as well as through building their capacity to deliver evidence-based policies.
  Increasing trade and investment cooperation in education, healthcare, environment, water & food security, clean energy and cyber security.
  Broadening security cooperation between the UK and Bahrain – keeping Britain, and our interests, safe.
  Strengthening bilateral relationship through engagement on science and innovation.
  Engaging with the next generation of thinkers.


Priorities for Bahrain
SIN activities in Bahrain are focused on the following priority thematic areas:


  Healthcare and life science
  Water Security
  Cyber Security and ICT
  Clean and Renewable Energy
  Future/SMART Cities
  Environment


Our services
The Gulf Science and Innovation Network consist of six officers covering all six Gulf Cooperation Council countries, with the Head of SIN (Gulf) leading from Doha. In Bahrain, SIN is based in the British Embassy in Bahrain. We also work closely with DIT and Political and Prosperity teams, as well as with the British Council.
