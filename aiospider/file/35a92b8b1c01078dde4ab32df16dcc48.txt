Award Number: DE-EE0008933CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Bioenergy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): WAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to Washington State University (WSU) to develop a novel anaerobic digestion (AD) process for treatment of sewage sludge. The resulting Advanced Pretreatment/Anaerobic Digestion technology (APAD) would seek to increase methane conversion efficiency, as compared to conventional AD methods. Sludge pretreatment would be integrated into the AD process in order to increase carbon efficiency.
