This document is for DWP staff and explains how the Access to Work scheme operates.

An Access to Work grant can pay for practical support if someone has a disability, health or mental health condition to help them:


  start working
  stay in work
  move into self-employment or start a business


Why we publish this guide

We publish this guide to help people understand how we make decisions.
