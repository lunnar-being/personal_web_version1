Role of department contact

The role of a department contact is to:


  be the first point of contact for civil servants using the spend controls in their department and answer any questions
  help the Cabinet Office controls officials with questions relating to their department
  work with their policy leads and the Cabinet Office controls officials to produce and be familiar with their department’s forward look
  develop an awareness of their department’s experience of the controls and provide feedback to  the Cabinet Office
  participate in, or makes sure that the appropriate officials interact with the  Cabinet Office and their department to continuously improve the controls
  make sure they are copied into all expenditure requests from their department, and into all decisions made by the Cabinet Office so there is a full audit trail


The department contacts work together with the Cabinet Office Central Controls Team (CCT). The CCT is responsible for coordinating and approving spend requests in a timely manner by:


  monitoring cases and addressing queries from departments or analysts
  updating departments on case progression, when required
  working with the HM Treasury (HMT) spending team to co-ordinate Cabinet Office input into HMT-led desk-based analysis and/or the Treasury Approval Point (TAP)
  setting a tone for Cabinet Office engagement with HMT and organisations
  mediating contentious controls cases and escalating cases to the cross-government controls group when necessary to make sure Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are met
  reviewing the final submissions ahead of ministerial approval to make sure all relevant parties were sent documents and had the chance to comment


The CCT works with HM Treasury (HMT), Infrastructure & Projects Authority (IPA) and department contacts to keep up-to-date with current and upcoming controls cases. The CCT also makes sure that all relevant parties are sent documents and approvals are processed within the Service Level Agreement (SLA).
