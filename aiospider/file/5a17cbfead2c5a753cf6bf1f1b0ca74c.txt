Advanced manufacturing and materials (AMM) Phase 2 is a £20 million investment programme and focuses on increasing the manufacturing or technology readiness levels of technologies, including those established in Phase 1, towards demonstration and commercialisation.

Phase 2 is output led. It will produce a technology demonstrator or a number of demonstrators that include advanced manufacturing or construction techniques; incorporating and developing the learning and technologies from the Phase 1 funded programme.

Demonstrations will involve trial builds (or equivalent) including one or more of the technologies funded in Phase 1. These will be relevant to factory-build, modular and advanced construction, and digital engineering execution and assurance. The techniques could then be applied to the build, maintenance and decommissioning of a nuclear sites as well as future technologies.

The competition is closed for new applications. Details of the competition’s aims and objectives can be found in the competition guidance.
