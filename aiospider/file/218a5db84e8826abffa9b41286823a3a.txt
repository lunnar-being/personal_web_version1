Award Number: DE-EE0008935CX(s) Applied: A9Bioenergy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): COOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Colorado State University (‘CSU’ – Ft. Collins, CO) to develop models for the analysis of biofuel pathways. Computer models would simulate and investigate engineering processes, sustainability indicators and other environmental effects of biofuel pathways. CSU would also complete technoeconomic and life-cycle analysis for the processes investigated.
