Apply to have your product listed

This is a voluntary scheme and is open to any disinfectant manufacturer wishing to market their product in the UK.

It lists disinfectants that have been independently validated as effective against viral and bacterial diseases affecting freshwater fish.

To apply to get your disinfectant listed you must:


  have your product tested by a qualified laboratory
  complete and submit the Aquaculture Disinfectant Listing Scheme Application Form (PDF, 409KB, 21 pages) by post and pay the application fee


Get your disinfectant tested

All products submitted for listing must meet the requirements of the EU Biocides Regulation (528/2012) and national biocides legislation.

Before applying you must ensure your product has passed the modified test standards below (depending on your application):


  bacterial diseases - using the specified modification of EN Standard 1656:2009
  viral diseases - using the specified modification of EN Standard 14675:2015


You must:


  select a laboratory that works to a recognised international laboratory quality system
  have quality assurance checks done by an independent auditor


Application fees

You can apply to have your disinfectant listed as effective for 1 disease type (bacterial or viral diseases) or for both.

You must pay for each disinfectant product you wish to list and choose either:


  a single scheme application (viral or bacterial efficacy) – £1,577 (excluding VAT)
  a combined application (viral and bacterial efficacy) – £2,157 (excluding VAT)


Fees are non-refundable for unsuccessful applications.

Approval process

The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) manages the process.


  It acknowledges receipt within 5 working days and sends it for technical review.
  It receives the results from the technical review within 20 working days.
  It sends you the results within 5 working days. If successful you must sign and return the terms and conditions of the listing scheme. If unsuccessful it will inform you of the reasons why and the next steps.
  It lists your product.


Renewals and changes to your product

Each listing is valid for 5 years. You must then reapply to continue to be listed. However, retesting is not always necessary if your disinfectant’s composition hasn’t changed.

If you change your product’s composition you should notify Cefas immediately. Product changes require a retest and you must then reapply for listing.

If you wish to add distributors for your listed products you need to apply for an amendment using the same application form (omit section 3 and the appendices). There is no charge to do this.

The disinfectant listed and sold must be identical to the original sample tested and reviewed.
