Award Number: DE-EE0008820CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6, B3.15Fuel Cell Technologies OfficeLocation(s): AZOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to Nikola Motor Company (Nikola) to fabricate, characterize and evaluate membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) with novel catalyst layer structures to improve performance and durability. Nikola would perform MEA tests using existing component accelerated stress tests (ASTs) and performance test protocols to verify the minimum platinum group metal (PGM) loading required for 25,000 hours of operation for heavy-duty truck applications. This work would be performed by Nikola under a service contract at Arizona State University (ASU) laboratories. Nikola is working to develop the capability to complete these activities at their own facility so these activities may also occur at Nikolaâ€™s dedicated laboratory facility in Phoenix, AZ later in the project. Commercial and experimental catalysts would be developed at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, GA and Northeastern University in Boston, MA. Catalyst layer model development and analysis would take place at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. Additionally, collaboration is expected to occur with the Fuel Cell Consortium for Performance and Durability (FC-PAD).
