 – On Friday, Deputy Secretary of Energy Mark W. Menezes will travel to Wisconsin to tour SHINE Medical Technologies Facilities and NorthStar Medical Radioisotopes. During his visit, the Deputy Secretary will see full size Mo-99 target solution vessels, driving accelerators, integrated safety systems, and the prototype Thermal Cycling and Absorption Process for separating deuterium and tritium gases.In 2017, President Trump outlined an initiative to “revive and expand” the U.S. nuclear sector. Friday’s visit will highlight the Department of Energy’s support of a program to reduce dependence on foreign imports and bring new opportunities to the heartland. Mo-99 is the parent isotope of technetium‑99m (Tc-99m), the most widely used radioisotope in medical diagnostic imaging. This essential medical radioisotope is used in approximately 80 percent of nuclear diagnostic imaging procedures, or about 40,000 medical procedures in the United States every day. Tc-99m is used to diagnose heart disease and the spread of cancer, to study organ structure and function, and to perform other important medical applications including the cardiac “nuclear stress test.”Media interested in covering the Deputy Secretary’s visit must RSVP to miki.carver@hq.doe.gov. ###News Media Contact: (202) 586-4940
