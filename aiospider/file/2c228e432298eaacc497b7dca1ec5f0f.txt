The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Nuclear Energy (NE) Office is accepting applications for its  solicitation. This funding opportunity will support first-of-its-kind nuclear demonstration readiness projects, advanced reactor development projects, and regulatory assistance.This solicitation aligns with the  initiative led by the DOE's . Under the H2@Scale effort, DOE's NE and EERE's FCTO are collaborating to identify synergies that accelerate nuclear and hydrogen technologies deployment. As one example, hydrogen and nuclear energy can be coupled by utilizing heat and electricity from advanced nuclear reactors to produce hydrogen and use it as a fuel or industrial commodity, in energy storage, or for other industrial purposes. Additional hydrogen opportunities also exist to optimize nuclear production when generation exceeds load on the grid.   Learn more about the , and  by February 28, 2020.
