Award Number: DE-EE0009082CX(s) Applied: A9Building Technologies OfficeLocation(s): NEOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to validate energy code compliance of a select set of modular multi-family buildings and compare that information to the electric and natural gas consumption of those buildings. Data would be collected on fully constructed buildings and buildings undergoing active construction in various representative climate regions in the United States. Results would be used to develop best practices for increased energy code compliance and energy efficiency of modular construction.
