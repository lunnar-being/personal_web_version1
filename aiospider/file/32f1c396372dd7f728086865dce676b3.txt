Award Number: DE-EE0008990CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.1, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): MIOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to Michigan Technological University (MTU) to investigate the technical, economic, and social impacts of coproducing pasture-fed rabbits and solar photovoltaic (PV) power: the “rabbit agrovoltaic concept” for dual-use of land in a way that is innovative and sustainable. Specifically, the proposed project would assess the viability of rabbit farming in the same location as PV arrays as an approach to lower costs by generating two revenue streams, reducing the need for mowing, and utilizing existing structures for necessary fencing.
