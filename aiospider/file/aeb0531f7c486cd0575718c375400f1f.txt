Award Number: DE-EE0009026CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): AROffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to the University of Arkansas (UA) to design, develop, and test cybersecurity software for the solar photovoltaic (PV) industry. A two-level defense would be formulated whereby inverter-level algorithms are developed to harden individual devices, then integrated with new system-level software to provide cross-layer security protection. Ultimately, a field test would be conducted based on installing a cyber-hardened prototype inverter alongside existing commercial PV inverters in order to assess the efficacy of this approach.
