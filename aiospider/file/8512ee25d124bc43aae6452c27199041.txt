Award Number: DE-EE0008733CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6, B5.15Wind Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): OROffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Oregon State University (OSU) to design, build, and test a novel collision detection system for off-shore wind turbines that would seek to reduce avian and bat collisions. The system would be capable of providing visual confirmation of collisions in both daytime and nighttime conditions via on-blade visible light and infrared cameras, as well as relaying data from remote locations. Both laboratory and field testing would be conducted to validate system performance.
