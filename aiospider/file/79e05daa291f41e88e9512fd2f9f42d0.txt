Award Number: DE-EE0008368CX(s) Applied: A9, B1.31, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): NHOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to Brayton Energy, LLC to design a commercial-scale gas-phase Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) solution that would be developed and demonstrated via a subscale test facility. The megawatt-scale demonstration system would absorb concentrated solar energy from a heliostat field and deliver it into thermal energy storage integrated with a high-efficiency supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) power cycle.
