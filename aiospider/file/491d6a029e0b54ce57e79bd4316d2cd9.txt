Award Number: DE-EE0008953CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Water Power Technologies OfficeLocation(s): NJOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Stevens Institute of Technology (SIT) to design, fabricate, and test a novel floating oscillating surge wave energy converter (F-OSWEC). Design specifications for a 1:2 scale prototype (100 kW annual averaged electrical power output) would be developed. A smaller, 1:20 scale model device would then be fabricated and used for performance testing at a wave energy testing facility over a two year period. A prototype power take-off (PTO) system and floating platform would also be developed in conjunction with the F-OSWEC.
