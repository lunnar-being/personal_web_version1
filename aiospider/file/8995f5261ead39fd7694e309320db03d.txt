If you’re taking part in the pilot of the Sustainable Farming Incentive, you must read this guidance. It forms part of your agreement.

It explains how Defra will monitor your progress with your agreement, what evidence you must keep, the rules around changes of circumstance and how a breach of your agreement or the regulations will be managed.
