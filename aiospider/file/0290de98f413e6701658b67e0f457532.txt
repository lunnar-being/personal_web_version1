These funding manuals provide information to schools and ITT providers on postgraduate teaching apprenticeship grant funding in England, including:


  criteria and requirements
  funding rates and funded subjects
  how payments are made

The postgraduate teaching apprenticeship is an ITT route that combines paid work with off-the-job training, qualifications and progression. It allows candidates to train to become qualified teachers.
