Another exhibit featured a Navy-designed smart helmet that receives and sends video and also relays spoken words as visible text messages. The helmet is meant to help commanding officers and subordinates communicate clearly to each other amid the confusion and noise of a combat area, according to Heidi Buck, director of the Navy’s Battlespace Exploitation of Mixed Reality Lab, where the helmet was engineered.“A gunner can see the officer’s commands instead of just hearing them. And the officer can see what the gunner is seeing,” she said. The helmet might also go into use in basic training, she added: A wearer could see virtual targets transposed into his or her real-life field of vision.
