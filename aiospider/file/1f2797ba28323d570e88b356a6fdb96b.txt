          Details


          

    
            
This licence allows you to disturb or capture bats by hand or by using:


  endoscopes
  static hand-held nets
  torches


You can disturb but not handle hibernating bats.

You need a:


  
level 1 licence if you only need to use a torch
  
level 3 licence to use mist nets and acoustic lures
  
level 4 licence to use harp traps


You must apply for an individual licence for survey, research or conservation work not covered by this licence, or a level 1, level 3, or level 4 licence.

For development work affecting bats, you must apply for a mitigation licence.

You must release all bats at the place where they were captured immediately after being examined.

Register with Natural England

Before you can use this licence, you must register with Natural England using the application form linked on this page.

When you need to pay

It costs £80 to register for a new CL18 licence.

From June 2022, it will cost £35 to renew your registration.

You must declare the intended use of the licence on your registration form. This will determine if you need to pay, such as to survey bats for development projects.

Natural England will refund unsuccessful applications.

Read the terms and conditions for paying for a wildlife licence.

When you do not need to pay

You do not need to pay if the licence is used for:


  voluntary purposes - any work you do is unpaid and you are registered with an organisation or charity as a volunteer
  conservation, science or research purposes - research related to the protected species is carried out by a student or employee of an academic institution or research body


How to pay

You can pay using a bank card. Follow the GOV.UK Pay link on the application form.

  have not held a licence for the species or a similar species for the last 3 years
  have a licence but want to add new methods


Report action taken

You must complete the survey return form by 30 June each year, even if you’ve taken no action or did not find target species. You’ll need the names of any accredited agents who carried out the surveys on your behalf.

  survey location (10 figure Ordnance Survey grid reference and what3words)
