Over the past year, nearly 70 buildings innovators gained critical technology-to-market pitch communication skills at four intensive  workshops held across the country. This cohort of selected IMPEL innovators included building technology researchers from national laboratories, small business owners, university faculty members and graduate students, as well as building architects, engineers, and entrepreneurs.......................Two expert IMPEL+ coaches with significant experience in technology commercialization led the workshops, using storyboarding, on-camera training, and interactive exercises.The IMPEL+ innovators arrived at the workshops with a one-minute pitch for their building technology hardware, software, material, product, program, or patent. Over the course of the day, they learned to deconstruct, rebuild, and refine their pitches, develop strong narratives, and identify unique value propositions. They were challenged to prepare their pitch for a potential funder, co-founder, private-sector collaborator or policymaker, and, in some cases, to gain access to test labs or manufacturing partners. They also gained experience through personalized guidance and collaboration with other innovative buildings professionals throughout the day.IMPEL+, , is a program funded by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Building Technologies Office and implemented by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.IMPEL+ integrates market-oriented skillsets with advanced scientific thinking. The program focuses on matching early-stage, building technology research and development activities with gaps, barriers, and other challenges that are observed in industry and the marketplace to catalyze private-sector engagement and impact.Hear from IMPEL+ Innovators in this .For photographs of past IMPEL+ Events, visit .For more information about IMPEL+ and how to apply for the FY21 IMPEL+ program, visit the  or contact Reshma Singh ().Group from the IMPEL+ Berkeley Workshop, November 2019.Scenes from the IMPEL+ Boston Workshop, February 2020.Group from the IMPEL+ Washington, D.C. Workshop, December 2019.Scenes from the IMPEL+ Boston Workshop, February 2020.Glimpses from the IMPEL+ Virtual Workshop, June 2020.
