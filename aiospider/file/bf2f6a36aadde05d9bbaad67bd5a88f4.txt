            CE04: information and communication technology
          
        
        

    Includes:

  purchase of computer hardware and software where these are to be capitalised

Excludes:

  costs of training for staff in the use of ICT systems (see E09) ·
  leasing costs: schools are not allowed to enter finance leases and all operating lease costs are revenue

Small purchases should not be capitalised. Your local authority should advise on an appropriate (de minimis) value, below which transactions should be charged to revenue.

Illustrative example:


  a local authority sets a de minimis level of £2000
  a school buys one computer costing £500: revenue expenditure
  a school buys five computers costing £500 each, or £2,500 in total: capital expenditure
