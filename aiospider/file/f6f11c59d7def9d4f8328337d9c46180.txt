    Large brands, particularly, are faltering and are often struggling to generate brand love among younger consumers. Millennials are four times more likely to avoid buying products from big-name food brands than their parents are. Further, e-marketplace giants are generating 65 percent of growth by the top 150 retailers, putting grocers under pressure and making them more difficult trading partners. As a result, the industry’s economic-profit growth has taken a nosedive. Additionally, consumer-goods companies face an investor-expectation gap. To meet current valuations, they need to add 100 to 150 basis points of annual organic growth to the industry’s precrisis growth rate, assuming constant margins.

Accomplishing those shifts will require a host of new capabilities in areas such as data-driven marketing, the digital route to market, next-generation productivity, and programmatic M&A.
