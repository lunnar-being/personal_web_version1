You are breaking the law if you do not submit your annual activity report by 31 March for the previous calendar year, or do not have the report verified by the relevant deadline. See the Environment Agency enforcement sanctions policy.


Record your F gas activities

You must record and report how much F gas you produce, import, export and destroy.

You can use your own system to keep records.

If you produce equipment containing F gas

You need to keep records of the:


  type of equipment that contains F gas if the F gas had not previously been placed on the GB market before charging
  quantity of each F gas that is being phased down that the equipment contains
  delivery notes and invoices from the F gas suppliers you have used


If you import equipment pre-charged with F gas

You need to keep records of the:


  type of equipment pre-charged with F gas imported
  number of units of each type of equipment pre-charged with F gas you placed on the GB market
  quantity of each F gas that is being phased down that you imported within equipment pre-charged with F gas
  declaration of conformity
  customs documents


If you import equipment pre-charged with F gas, and that F gas had already been placed on the market in Great Britain , exported and charged in the equipment outside GB, you must keep the:


  delivery note or invoice from the organisation that placed the F gas on the market in GB
  declaration that they have reported them as placed on the market


If you destroy F gas

You must keep records of:


  how much of each F gas you destroy
  the technologies used to destroy the F gases
  the quantity of each of the F gases that you have in stock at the end of the year that are waiting to be destroyed


If you use F gas as feedstock

You must keep records of how much of each F gas you use.

When to report your F gas activities

You must report F gas activities if, in the previous calendar year, you:


  produced, imported or exported 1 tonne of F gas, or F gas equivalent to 100 tonnes or more of carbon dioxide (CO2)
  destroyed 1 tonne of F gas or F gas equivalent to 1,000 tonnes or more of CO2
  placed F gas that you must report on equivalent to 500 tonnes or more of CO2 in pre-charged equipment on the GB market
  placed pre-charged refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump equipment on the GB market if hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) contained in the equipment have not been placed on the GB market before


If you used HFCs, perfluorocarbons or sulphur hexafluoride equivalent to 1,000 tonnes of CO2 as feedstock in the previous calendar year, you must submit an F gas report.

Find out how to calculate the weight of an F gas in carbon dioxide equivalent.

When your report needs verifying

You must submit an independent audit report in addition to your F gas annual report, if you placed on the GB market:


  F gases equivalent to 10,000 tonnes or more of CO2
  
F gas that you must report on equivalent to 100 tonnes or more of CO2 in pre-charged equipment
  pre-charged refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump equipment  if hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) contained in the equipment have not been placed on the GB market before


If you imported or produced F gases equivalent to or exceeding 10,000 tonnes of CO2

If you report that you produced or imported bulk HFCs equivalent to 10,000 tonnes of CO2 in the previous calendar year, you must submit an independent audit report.

If you import pre-charged equipment containing an equivalent to or exceeding 100 tonnes CO2 of HFCs, an independent auditor must verify:


  the accuracy and consistency of your declaration of conformity and annual reports
  that you had enough quota authorisations to import the HFCs in the equipment


How to get your report verified

You can use a:


  verifier accredited to verify greenhouse gas emission reports or tonne-kilometre reports under the EU Emissions Trading System
  verifier that is accredited to verify financial statements


The verifier will check your data on:


  substances you produced, imported and exported
  main areas of application
  quantities you placed on the GB market
  exempt uses of the HFCs

  quantities you recycled, reclaimed or destroyed
  stocks
  authorisations you granted to equipment manufacturers and importers


If you report that you supplied any quantity of HFCs directly to an exporter in the previous calendar year, then you must get an independent verifier to verify this data.

Keep your verification report for 5 years.

You’ll need to be able to show it to your regulator.

Submitting your verification report

You must submit your verification report to the Environment Agency F gas support team.


Email: f-gassupport@enviroment-agency.gov.uk


When you need to submit your reports

You must report your F gas activity by 31 March for the previous calendar year.

You must submit verification reports by:


  31 March (for the previous year) - if you imported pre-charged equipment containing HFCs equivalent to or in excess of 100 tonnes of CO2
  30 June (for the previous year) - if you reported that you produced or imported bulk HFCs equivalent to or in excess of 10,000 tonnes of CO2



Example 
You have until 31 March 2022 to report your F gas activities during 2021.


How to submit your F gas report



If you don’t have an organisation ID from the GB F gas Registry, you need to first register for an account.


Download, fill in and submit the annual report to the Environment Agency F gas support team.


Submit an independent verified report, if required.
