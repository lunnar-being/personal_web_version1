This Defence and Security Accelerator (DASA) competition, run on behalf of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), aims to develop and demonstrate the components of a telexistence solution to the defence and security community. There is the potential for this competition (Phase 1) to be followed by a second competition (Phase 2) which will invite proposals to tailor their telexistence systems to meet a defence and security use case.

£650k is available for this Phase 1 to fund multiple proposals, with projects completing by 31 May 2021 and showcasing their innovation at a demonstration event to be held in the UK. We anticipate bids to be no more than £100k, but we have not set an upper threshold for the amount of proposals which may be funded as part of this Phase 1 competition. Please discuss with a DASA Innovation Partner if your proposal is over £100k.
This call closes at midday GMT on Thursday 19 November 2020.
