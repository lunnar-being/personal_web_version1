In this episode of Fellow Fellow, Mark talks to Flavia Chen, a public health researcher, on the current state and future paths of public health data. The conversation weaves through topics surrounding public health data and, as Flavia puts it, “what health related information is collected, who collects it, on whom, how it's used, how it's shared, how it's stored - and then at a more ethical level, how individual and collective rights, like privacy, are balanced with broader public interests.” is a public health researcher and fellow fellow of mine at the TAPP Project. Prior to the fellowship, she was the Deputy Program Manager for the Program in Prenatal and Pediatric Genome Sequencing at University of California San Francisco. Her research interests focus on the ethical and policy implications of translational genomics, including issues of data governance, as well as on social and policy influences on health outcomes. Flavia’s work has been published in The Hastings Center Report, Genetics in Medicine, and Pediatrics among others. She earned her MPH from the University of Washington.
