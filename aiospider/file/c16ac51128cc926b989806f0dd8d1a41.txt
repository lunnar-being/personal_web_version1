The market has lost almost half of its value in one year and around 87,000 direct jobs have been affected.Domestic expenditures has been the most resilient segment, even though it has declined by 27 percent; however, both business and leisure segments should return to their pre-crisis levels in 2022 (faster than other countries such as France, UK, Italy, or Spain). The business inbound segment will recover to pre-crisis levels only by 2024, and hence the entire market is not expected to return to its pre-crisis level until then (close to European average).Outbound expenditures dropped significantly between 2019 and 2020, and although the leisure segment will recover pre-crisis levels in 2023, the business segment wonâ€™t yet have recovered in 2030.
