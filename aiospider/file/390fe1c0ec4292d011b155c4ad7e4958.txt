This guidance will support people and organisations when considering or reviewing MECC activity and aid local implementation and measurement of programme impact. Organisations will find these resources useful when addressing MECC service condition SC8 within the NHS Standard Contract.

The NHS Standard Contract requires providers to develop and maintain an organisational plan for making every contact count, in accordance with MECC principles and guidance. The standard condition SC8 refers to the use of MECC tools, which are available above on this webpage. These resources were developed by Public Health England (PHE), Health Education England and the national MECC advisory group.

The resources are for use by organisations:


  considering or reviewing MECC activity
  developing or commissioning new MECC training
  seeking evidence, to measure the impact of local MECC delivery
  undertaking a review of existing MECC training resources
  developing and providing MECC training resources
