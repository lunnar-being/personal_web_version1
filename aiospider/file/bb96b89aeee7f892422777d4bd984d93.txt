This report recommends investment in hubs to produce aseptic injectable medicines in England in order to create high volumes of aseptic pharmacy products which will:


  save time for nursing staff
  enable care closer to home
  produce significant savings


The report was commissioned by the Minister of State for Health to provide advice to the government and NHS England and Improvement (NHSE/I), to regional, system, and trust pharmacy leads, as well as independent sector aseptic pharmacy providers.
