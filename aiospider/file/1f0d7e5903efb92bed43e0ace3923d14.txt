          Details


          

    
            
The consolidated list is compiled from 7 lists in various pieces of international legislation which set out what types of goods are controlled.

Use the online checker tools to establish:


  if your items are controlled
  the appropriate control entry reference in the consolidated list
  if an appropriate open general export licence (OGEL) exists


If your items are listed under a control list (‘rating’) entry you need an export licence from the Export Control Joint Unit (ECJU).

If your goods are not on the control lists, you may still need a licence under end-use controls. This applies where there are concerns over their use in a weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programme.

Types of controlled goods

Broad categories are:


  items specifically designed or modified for military use and their components
  
dual-use items that can be used for civil or military purposes
  associated technology and software
  goods that might be used for torture

  radioactive sources


Updates to the UK strategic export control lists

Updates to this list occur about twice a year. It is your responsibility to ensure that you:


  are aware of all recent updates to the lists
  check the latest version
  take appropriate action to get a licence where necessary
