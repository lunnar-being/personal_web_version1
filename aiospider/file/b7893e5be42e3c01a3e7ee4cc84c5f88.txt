Advances in digital technologies, artifical intelligence and data science techniques require good quality, accessible data. Data is critical to Dstl and to the nation as a whole, so we need to treat it as a valuable asset.

In this non-technical guide, data science experts from Dstl help you understand data and why itâ€™s so important, as well as exploring troubles with data, data-wrangling, documentation, data management and more.

Crumbs! is one of a series of biscuit books, designed to be dipped into and easily digested - just like a biscuit with tea.
