Award Number: DE-EE0009347CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6, B5.15Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): FLOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to University of Central Florida (UCF) to characterize field-exposed solar photovoltaic (PV) modules to identify causes of degradation. Existing modules would be characterized both at UCFâ€™s campuses and at field locations operated by project partners. Novel imaging tools would be developed to enable in-field imaging of PV modules without requiring that they be disconnected. Pilot versions of the tools would be developed and tested as part of the project.
