Introduction


Behaviours are the actions and activities that we undertake which result in effective performance of our roles.

The aim of this section is to help you understand your own behaviours in role and how you can go about proactively adapting them moving forwards, as you progress in your career.

So if you want to ensure you’re able to communicate in a clear, constructive way or ensure that you’re developing in to a fair and inclusive leader, then you may want to investigate the opportunities on this page.

Most of the learning in the Analysis Function (AF) Learning Curriculum is free but any learning that does have a cost associated is indicated by a £ sign.  We’ve also indicated where learning aligns to the 70:20:10 model.
