Artificial Intelligence is a technology that has the potential to greatly improve our public services by reducing costs, enhancing quality, and freeing up valuable time of frontline staff.

Recognising this, the UK Government published the Data Ethics Framework and A Guide to using AI in the Public Sector to enable public bodies to adopt AI systems in a way that works for everyone in society.

These new procurement guidelines will help inform and empower buyers in the public sector, helping them to evaluate suppliers, then confidently and responsibly procure AI technologies for the benefit of citizens.
