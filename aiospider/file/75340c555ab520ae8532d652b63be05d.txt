 “Tributes for Colin Powell are pouring in on a bipartisan basis and for good reason: He was a Marshall-esque giant of American national security and the kind of public figure that had a quiet form of greatness that is rare and getting rarer.Colin was already a distinguished leader when I had my first (very junior) Pentagon job in 1980. He was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs when I was Assistant Secretary in the 1990s. Though senior to me during all these years, he went out of his way to engage with me. Much later, when I served in more senior positions in the Pentagon, he offered advice and counsel. In the years since, we have taken part in many meetings together, private and public, and his views were always insightful.Colin’s passing leaves a big hole in American public life. It also reminds us of the tremendous impact we can have when we devote ourselves to public service. Stephanie and I send our condolences to Alma.”
