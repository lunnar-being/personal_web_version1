The testing will take place at two sites, one located in Sequim Bay and one in Clallam Bay. Sequim Bay was selected because of its relatively protected, calmer waters—an ideal scenario for competitors to test their devices in the ocean for the first time and practice maneuvering before heading to the open ocean. Clallam Bay offers the necessary wave conditions for competitors to demonstrate their devices’ wave-powered recharging capabilities. Competitors will have access to helpful data that details the area’s conditions as well as support from experts and engineering facilities at .Scheduled for September 2022, the SPLASH Contest is designed to assess the endurance and performance of finalists’ wave energy harvesting, self-charging autonomous vehicles in real-world sea conditions. During the multi-day test, competing teams will demonstrate all functional aspects of their prototypes, including their ability to maneuver, self-charge, collect data, and communicate wirelessly. At the end of the test, one to three awards totaling up to $1.5 million will be awarded.
