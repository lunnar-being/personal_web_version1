          Details


          

    
            
The framework sets out how Ofsted, together with Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons and the Care Quality Commission, will inspect secure training centres. This framework came into force in April 2019.

We carried out assurance visits of secure training centres from September 2020 until March 2021. View archived guidance on these assurance visits.

              19 March 2021
              Removed guidance on assurance visits as these are no longer taking place. We have revised the secure training centres framework to take the 2019 education inspection framework into account and updated the timeline so there is a shorter timescale to report publication. We have also revised the Annex A form.
            
            
              17 August 2020
              Added guidance on assurance visits that Ofsted will carry out from 1 September 2020 and updated letter requesting information for visits.
            
            
              13 March 2019
              Revised the secure training centre framework following a consultation in July to August 2018 and added a model letter and request for information. Inspectors will begin using this on 1 April 2019.
            
            
              21 December 2017
              Youth Justice Board references updated to Youth Custody Service. New paragraph 22 confirms inspectors follow the HMIP urgent notification process where necessary.
            
            
              6 February 2017
              Slight amendments to paragraph 6 on page 3 (clarifying regulatory responsibilities) and paragraph 12 on page 4 (about communication with young people, including individual meetings).
            
            
              11 November 2015
              Paragraph 6 revised for clarity; footnote 5 updated with new link.
