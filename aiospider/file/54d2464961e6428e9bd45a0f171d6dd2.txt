These standards are techniques that you can use in the fields of hydrological analysis and hydraulic modelling. Use this best practice guidance to help you:


  build hydraulic models using the source, pathway, receptor and model approach concept
  review hydraulic models
  maintain consistency across the flood risk management industry
  improve the quality of your applications
  plan and prioritise targeted model updates


Technical standards
These standards are also available as a PDF (LIT56326) that gives more background information for hydraulic modelling and uses technical and scientific language.

Email enquiries@environment-agency.gov.uk to request a copy of the PDF.

Fluvial model assessment tool
You can use the Microsoft Excel-based fluvial model assessment tool (LIT56342) alongside these standards. The tool will help you assess the quality of a hydraulic model without completing a full technical review.

Email enquiries@environment-agency.gov.uk to request a copy of the tool.
