          Details


          

    
            
An updated Surveillance Camera Code was laid before Parliament on 16 November 2021 pursuant to Section 31(3) of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012. Subject to receiving parliamentary approval, the updated Code is due to come into effect on 12 January 2022.


Relevant authorities and users of surveillance camera systems should continue to follow the current published Code until the updated version comes into effect.


The government is committed to empowering the police to use technologies like biometrics and surveillance cameras to protect the public while maintaining their trust.

Simplifying and updating the Code is important in this context because the Code provides guidance on the appropriate use of surveillance camera systems by local authorities and the police.

We have updated references to subsequent legislation, in particular the Data Protection Act 2018, and the Court of Appeal judgment on live facial recognition in Bridges v South Wales Police.

We have also shortened the text to make it easier for users to follow. The updated Code does not place any additional burden on users.

Before laying the Code before Parliament the Home Office conducted a statutory consultation. Details of the consultation and responses are in the accompanying document.
