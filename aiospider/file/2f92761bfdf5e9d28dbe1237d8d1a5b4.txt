The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office (HFTO) and Nuclear Energy (NE) Office are joining forces to advance technologies that can efficiently integrate nuclear power and hydrogen. Up to $20 million in total funds will be available through DOE's Funding Opportunity to demonstrate systems that produce hydrogen using nuclear energy or the heat from nuclear power plants.This opportunity is part of DOE's  vision for clean and affordable hydrogen production, storage, transport, and use in multiple sectors and across applications. By helping decarbonize these key sectors, these projects will support the Biden administration's goal of a 100% clean energy economy with net-zero emissions no later than 2050.for this funding opportunity by April 30, 2021.
