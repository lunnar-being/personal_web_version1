          Details


          

    
            
These are the statutory programmes of study and attainment targets for music at key stages 1 to 3. They are issued by law; you must follow them unless there’s a good reason not to.

All local-authority-maintained schools should teach them.

Further guidance is available to accompany the music programme of study at key stages 1, 2 and 3.

Short films of teachers and subject experts talking about the national curriculum and how to use it are also available.
