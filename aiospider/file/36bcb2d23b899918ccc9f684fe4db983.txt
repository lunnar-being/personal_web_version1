Use this list to find out what:


  disciplines are covered by Arts Council England or its associated bodies
  technical or business skills are covered by Tech Nation
  disciplines covered by the endorsing bodies for science, engineering, humanities and medicine


The Home Office cannot advise you on which endorsing body is best placed to consider your skill set. The disciplines each endorsing body consider are listed in this guidance, and you should read this carefully to identify an appropriate endorsing body. The endorsing bodies do not cover an exhaustive list of disciplines, and it may be that your speciality cannot currently be assessed.

If you are ineligible to be considered by an endorsing body, you should consider whether alternative immigration categories would be more suitable. A full list of alternative work routes is available on GOV.UK.
