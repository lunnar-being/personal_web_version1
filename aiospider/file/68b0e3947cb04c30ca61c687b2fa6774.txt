Under International law, all States have the right to conduct marine science research subject to the rights and duties of other States. The law provides that all States are required to promote and facilitate the development and conduct of MSR in accordance with the Law of the Sea Convention.  As part of this, the FCDO work with others to review proposals by foreign researchers and act as intermediary for UK proposals. Guidance has been developed to benefit both applicants to and from the UK but will also help UK embassies abroad and foreign embassies at home.


For applicants who wish to conduct marine scientific research in the UK (including UK Overseas Territories) please fill in the research application form.
