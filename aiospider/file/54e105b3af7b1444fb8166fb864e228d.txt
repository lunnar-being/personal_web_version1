Award Number: DE-EE0009345CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): FLOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to The University of Central Florida Board of Trustees (UCF) to test bifacial photovoltaic (PV) modules to understand effects related to potential induced degradation (PID). Factors leading to degradation would be quantified and models for predicting PID would be developed to improve the design and installation configuration of bifacial modules for increased reliability.
