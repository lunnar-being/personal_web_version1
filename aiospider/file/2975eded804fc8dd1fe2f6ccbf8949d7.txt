Information Quality at OMB





Final Office of Management and Budget Information Quality Guidelines
 (October 1, 2002) (9 pages, 98 kb)These guidelines describe OMB’s policy for ensuring the quality of information that OMB disseminates to the public and sets forth the administrative procedure by which an affected person may obtain correction of information disseminated by OMB.
Forthcoming Influential Scientific Disseminations (Peer Review Agenda)
Based on the review conducted, OMB has not identified any upcoming influential scientific information (including highly scientific assessments) within the definitions promulgated by OMB’s bulletin M-05-03, Final Information Quality Bulletin on Peer Review. Therefore, OMB currently has no agenda of forthcoming influential scientific disseminations to post on its website in accordance with the Bulletin. If such documents are identified, they will be posted for public review.
