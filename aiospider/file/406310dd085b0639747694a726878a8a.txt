          Details


          

    
            
Low Value Provision (LVP) is used to provide short vocational and occupational training to claimants who have a job offer or need training to be able to compete for vacancies in their local labour market.

The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) follows the policies and procedures in the documents listed here.

Online application

To bid for and supply LVP opportunities you need to complete an online application form.

Before completing the form, give due consideration to your responses as failure to meet the requirements will prevent you from delivering training.

As part of your application you will need to tell us the counties that you wish to deliver training in and the types of training that you can provide.

On completing the form, you will also be asked to state whether or not you agree to the terms and conditions of contract to deliver LVP.

Once you have lodged an application, it will remain current for 12 months or until your circumstances change, whichever is the earliest.
