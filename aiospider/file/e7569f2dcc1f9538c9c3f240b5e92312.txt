Award Number: DE-EE0009069CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Building Technologies OfficeLocation(s): CAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Gas Technology Institute (GTI) to develop a production process for the construction of energy efficient, modular homes. Both process automation and the incorporation of emerging envelope technologies would be investigated. A pilot home would be constructed and commissioned for performance testing. It would then be installed at a cold climate site in California and monitored for one (1) heating season. A data acquisition system and sensor package would be used to monitor energy usage, indoor air quality, and other relevant variables.
