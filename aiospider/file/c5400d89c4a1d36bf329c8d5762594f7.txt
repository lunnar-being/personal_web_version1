          Details


          

    
            
This document sets out how the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) and the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) work together where their duties for health and safety enforcement and accident investigation overlap at the water margin, offshore and on inland waterways in and around the United Kingdom.

This MOU is underpinned by an operational working agreement (OWA) that outlines the key and supporting principles to be adopted when selecting the lead organisation for health and safety enforcement and accident investigation. The OWA also provides example scenarios that identify the lead organisation in a range of work activities.
