          Details


          

    
            
On behalf of the Royal Air Force (RAF) DASA is running a Market Exploration to investigate zero emission options for the replacement of the existing fleet of military light training aircraft.  The RAF currently operates a fleet of light aircraft across a variety of sites in the UK.  The RAF customer wishes to better understand the market capability in this area and seeks information on the development of relevant technologies and systems that are in development and maturing over the coming 4 years.  This information will be used to inform the user requirement specifications for a replacement system.  The target date for replacement of the existing fleet is 2027.

This Market Exploration activity will not be followed by a formal DASA competition.
