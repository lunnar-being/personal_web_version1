Though the Dutch are slightly more optimistic about the economic future than they were a few months ago, they expect the impact of COVID-19 to continue to last well over two more months. In the short term, consumers have cut back on spending across nearly all categories. More than half of consumers have tried a different shopping behavior, including trying new brands and shopping methods, some of which they may keep long-term. They also expect to buy a larger share of their purchases online than before the crisis. Most consumers who have not yet regularly returned to stores are waiting to see milestones beyond the lifting of restrictions, and plan to reduce their out-of-home activity in the short term.These exhibits are based on survey data collected in the Netherlands from June 18â€“21, 2020. Check back for regular updates on Dutch consumer sentiments, behaviors, income, spending, and expectations.
