These ready reckoners and transition matrices apply to 2018 and 2019 key stage 4 revised data.

Ready reckoners

The pupil Progress 8 ready reckoner calculates the Progress 8 score for an individual pupil.

The school Progress 8 ready reckoner shows how we calculate your school’s Progress 8 score from individual pupil Progress 8 scores.
