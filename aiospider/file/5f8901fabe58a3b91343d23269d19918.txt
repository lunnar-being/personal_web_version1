This Defence and Security Accelerator (DASA) competition is seeking proposals for innovative technologies that allow law enforcement officers to safely prevent the escalation of conflict in serious or violent circumstances from a distance. The primary focus will be on solutions for distances between 5m and 50m (but solutions for distances between 0m and 70m will be considered).

At the end of the Phase 1 competition, we expect the innovation to be sufficiently developed to achieve either proof of concept or prototype demonstration.

The total funding available in this Phase 1 competition is £500k (excluding VAT) to fund up to 9 proposals. This competition closes for submissions at midday BST on Thursday 15 October 2020.
