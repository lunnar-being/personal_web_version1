          Details


          

    
            
The Longer Duration Energy Storage Demonstration innovation competition aims to accelerate commercialisation of innovative longer duration energy storage projects (excluding commercial solutions such as pumped hydro / lithium ion) at different technology readiness levels, through first-of-a-kind (FOAK) full-system prototypes or actual demonstrations.

There are 2 strands of the competition, and this page provides guidance that covers both.

Please send any comments or questions about the competition via email to smart.innovation@BEIS.gov.uk.
