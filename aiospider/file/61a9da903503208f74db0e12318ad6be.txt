The Net Zero Research and Innovation Framework is a guide to the research and technologies needed to reach net zero by 2050.

Produced under the guidance of the governmentâ€™s Net Zero Innovation Board, it identifies the main net zero research and innovation challenges for the UK over the next 5 to 10 years and across key sectors.

The Framework supports an evidence-based programme of public sector research and innovation and provides information for businesses and academics working on net zero related research.
