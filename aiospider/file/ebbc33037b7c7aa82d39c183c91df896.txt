Award Number: DE-EE0009071CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Building Technologies OfficeLocation(s): AKOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Cold Climate Housing Research Center (CCHRC) to develop a novel modular building system incorporating vacuum insulated panel (VIP) technology. The system would be designed to increase the energy efficiency of residential buildings in extremely cold climates. As part of the project, prototype paneling components and associated equipment would be used to erect a partial mock housing assembly, which would in turn be used for performance testing of paneling components.
