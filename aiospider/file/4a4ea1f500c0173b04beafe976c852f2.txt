Our seas are vast and complex and there is much still to learn and understand about their delicate ecosystems. Access to high quality evidence is critical to this.

Evidence influences much of our work, ensuring we continue to make informed decisions using the most up to date research to manage the increasing demands on the marine environment and its resources

Evidence strategy

The Marine Management Organisation’s (MMO) Evidence strategy 2020 -2025 sets MMO priorities for evidence that will ensure our delivery is underpinned with excellent science delivered in the most efficient way over the next five years. This strategy readies MMO for the new challenges faced and builds from MMO previous Evidence Strategy 2015 to 2020
.

Evidence requirements

As part of the strategy development we reviewed our evidence requirements. Each evidence requirement has a more detailed Evidence Delivery Plan. This includes research requirements, how the evidence will be used, a proposed method for filling the gap and a summary of existing evidence and current activity.

Evidence reports

Knowledge sharing and collaboration is an important part of our evidence strategy. All our evidence reports are published and available online.
