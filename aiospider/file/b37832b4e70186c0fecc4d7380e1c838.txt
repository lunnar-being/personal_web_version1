 – Today, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced the members of the National Quantum Initiative Advisory Committee (NQIAC), which will counsel the Administration on ways to ensure continued American leadership in quantum information science (QIS).“Today, the White House is proud to join DOE to announce the members of the NQIAC, an important step forward for the National Quantum Initiative. We look forward to engaging with the entire U.S. innovation ecosystem to advance quantum research and innovation for the betterment of our Nation,” said U.S. Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios."The Department of Energy is proud to join the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in the formation of the National Quantum Initiative Advisory Committee," said Under Secretary for Science Paul Dabbar. "By organizing a way to harness our rapidly evolving quantum technologies, this committee will help transform and evolve applications for the future."President Trump established the NQIAC by  as part of the bipartisan National Quantum Initiative Act of 2018. The legislation accelerated QIS research and development investment and policy coordination across the Federal government.The NQIAC will be co-chaired by Dr. Charles Tahan, OSTP Assistant Director for Quantum Information Science and Director of the National Quantum Coordination Office, and Dr. Kathryn Ann Moler, Dean of Research at Stanford University. Committee members represent industry, universities, Federal laboratoties, and other Federal Government agencies.Members of the National Quantum Initiative Advisory Committee include:Professor Timothy A.
