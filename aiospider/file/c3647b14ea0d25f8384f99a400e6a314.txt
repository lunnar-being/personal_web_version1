The government has announced 2 significant new support packages that will help protect the science jobs that will be essential for our future prosperity, and ensure that critical research projects can continue:


  from this autumn, UK universities will be able to access a series of government grants and long-term, low interest loans covering up to 80% of their income losses caused by an expected decline in international students, ensuring that their crucial research can continue

  around £280 million government funding will be made available to universities impacted by coronavirus. This will fund extensions to grants, allowing them to continue developing ambitious and innovative research projects, funded through UK Research & Innovation (UKRI) and the National Academies, including supporting researchers’ salaries and other research costs like laboratory equipment and fieldwork.


See the SURE package for more detail of these packages and how they will be implemented.
