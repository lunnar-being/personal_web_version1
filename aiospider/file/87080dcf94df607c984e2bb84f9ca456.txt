Award Number: DE-EE0008970CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): OHOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to the University of Toledo to address the critical hurdles for perovskite solar cell (PSC) commercialization. The project would be comprised of three Budget Periods (BP). BP1 research would evaluate the intrinsic stability of PSCs and develop tailored accelerated lifetime test (ALT) protocols to reliably predict the lifetime of PSC modules. In BP2, ALT protocols would be refined and applied to small prototypes ("minimodules") fabricated in-lab using scalable techniques. Final project tasks in BP3 would involve the development of PSC packaging methods and outdoor testing of minimodules to verify the predicted lifetime.
