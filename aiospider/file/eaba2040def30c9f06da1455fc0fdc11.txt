The US government is increasingly relying on export controls to restrict foreign companies from accessing critical made-in-America components. Within the US Commerce Department, the Bureau of Industry Security (BIS) maintains the “Entity List” of blacklisted firms under export control restrictions. This list has traditionally not received much attention, as policymakers tend to focus on more widely publicized Treasury Department and State Department sanctions. However, in the last 10 years the Entity List has increased nine-fold to nearly 1,200 entities, as hundreds of companies from China’s Huawei to Russia’s Gazprom join the ranks of foreign firms prohibited from receiving U.S. exports.  While sanctions primarily focus on limiting the movement of money, people, and weapons, export controls focus on limiting the movement of physical goods.  “is a list of parties for which the United States Government maintains restrictions on certain exports, reexports, or transfers of items.” If a foreign party is on the Entity List, US companies are banned from exporting, reexporting, or transferring items to that party, unless that US company gets a special license requirement that allows them to bypass Export Administration Regulations ().
