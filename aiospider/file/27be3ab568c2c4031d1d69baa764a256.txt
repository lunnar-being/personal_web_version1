          Details


          

    
            
The UK will create a new immigration route for British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) citizens from Hong Kong, reflecting the unique and unprecedented circumstances in Hong Kong and the UK’s historic and moral commitment to BN(O)s.

This policy statement sets out how the new ‘Hong Kong BN(O) Visa’ will operate.

Further guidance about the new immigration route is available for BN(O) citizens in Hong Kong.
