          Details


          

    
            
The Ten point plan for a green industrial revolution sets out an ambition to deploy CCUS at scale in 2 of the UK’s industrial clusters by the mid-2020s, and a further 2 by 2030 in order to help the UK meet our net zero and Carbon Budget 6 targets.

Phase-1 of the Cluster Sequencing Process identified and sequenced CCUS clusters which are suited to deployment in the mid-2020s (known as Track-1). On 19 October, Hynet and the East Coast Cluster were announced as Track-1 Clusters.

We also announced the Scottish Cluster as a reserve cluster if a back-up is needed. A reserve cluster is one which met the eligibility criteria and performed to a good standard against the evaluation criteria. As such, we will continue to engage with the Scottish Cluster throughout Phase-2 of the sequencing process, to ensure it can continue its development and planning. This means that if government chooses to discontinue engagement with a cluster in Track-1, we can engage with this reserve cluster instead.

Who can apply for Phase-2

Phase-2 is open to Power, Industrial Carbon Capture and Hydrogen production projects which meet the technology specific eligibility criteria. Detailed guidance on the eligibility criteria and application process for each of these technologies can be found in the Guidance document.

Greenhouse Gas Removal (GGR) technologies such as Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) and Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) technologies with an interest in requesting access to Track 1 clusters are invited to complete an Expression of Interest (EoI) for a separate process that aims to run in parallel with the Phase-2 process.

How to apply

The first step is for the Project Representative to complete an expression of interest form and send it to the relevant email address below:


  Power projects – Powerccusphase2@beis.gov.uk

  Industrial projects – Industrialccusphase2@beis.gov.uk

  Hydrogen projects – Hydrogenccusphase2@beis.gov.uk

  GGR projects – ggrccuseoi@beis.gov.uk




The deadline for all expressions of interest except the GGR version is 23:59pm on 3 December 2021.

The deadline for GGR projects is now 6 January 2022. We have updated the GGR EoI form with a slightly different list of metrics.


Guidance on the submission process up to and beyond this point is included in the Guidance document.

Heads of terms and ICC business model update

We have also published:

Please read this document in conjunction with the October 2021 ICC business model update.

Help and guidance

For full background and guidance on entering the process, please refer to the documents above, including the clarification questions page which we will update on a weekly basis with any questions received.

You can also read our questions and answers page about Cluster sequencing for CCUS deployment: Phase-1.
