Record ozone-depleting substances

You can use your own system to keep records.

You must record amounts of:


  ODS
  equipment containing ODS



If you destroy ODS you must record and report the:


  quantity of each of the gases that you destroyed
  technologies used to destroy the gases
  quantity of each of the gases that you held in stock at the end of the year that are to be destroyed


When you need to report

You must report your ODS activity by 31 March for the previous calendar year to the Environment Agency.

How to submit your report



If you don’t have an organisation ID from the GB ODS Registry, you need to first register for an account.


Download, fill in and submit the annual report to the Environment Agency F gas support team.
