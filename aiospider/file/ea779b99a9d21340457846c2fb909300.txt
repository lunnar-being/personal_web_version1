Editor's note: this article was originally posted on Jefferson Lab's . Two videoconferencing poster sessions featuring the projects and research carried out by college undergraduates who participated in science summer internship programs at the Department of Energy’s Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility will be held for the news media, invited guests and members of the lab community. Each intern will present his/her work via a pre-recorded video that will be shown via videoconference. The interns will be available to discuss their work with videoconference attendees in a Q&A following each video presentation.DOE national laboratories provide a unique opportunity for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce development by offering access to leading scientists in large-scale, multidisciplinary research programs. During the summer, the interns developed unique research knowledge while working on a wide variety of projects, from scientific instrument R&D to data analysis. Thursday, July 30, 2020 at 10 a.m. - noon &            Friday, July 31, 2020 at 10 a.m. - noon• 13 students participating in the .• 8 students participating in the .• 1 awardee participating in the . Credentialed members of the media may attend the videoconference events. Contact Kandice Carter, Jefferson Lab Communications Office, if your news agency would like to attend. The interns’ respective summer projects directly involved them in the culture, activities and science of a U.S. Department of Energy national laboratory. Project topics ranged from accelerator and nuclear physics, to experimental research, to engineering and other STEM fields.Contact: Kandice Carter, Jefferson Lab Communications Office, 757-269-7263,
