Award Number: DE-EE0009078CX(s) Applied: A9Building Technologies OfficeLocation(s): DCOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) to further develop the DOE Commercial Code Field Study methodology to consider commercial buildings that use complex mechanical systems and/or adhere to the performance path methodology for code compliance. This project would continue work IMT had previously undertaken to develop a code compliance methodology, which has since been adopted by DOE as a standard methodology (DOE Award No. DE-EE0007619 â€“ DE-FOA-0001532; CXs A9, A11). IMT would visit new commercial building locations and active construction sites to collect data on code compliance and energy performance. Guidelines and training materials would then be developed using the data collected and disseminated to code officials and other relevant stakeholders. The project would be completed over two Budget Periods (BPs), with a Go/No-Go Decision Point in between each BP.
