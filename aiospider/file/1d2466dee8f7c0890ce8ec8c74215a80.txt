Award Number: DE-EE0009269CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Bioenergy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): NJOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to the Trustees of Princeton University to develop a thermomicrobial-electrochemical (T-MEC) process to convert food waste and resulting wastewater into jet fuel. The project would design, develop, fabricate, and pilot test hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) reactors and microbial electrolysis (MEC) reactors. These would be integrated, forming the T-MEC process, to show that it can produce a sufficient amount of renewable jet blend stocks for testing using actual food waste obtained from a food processing plant and restaurants.
