Award Number: DE-EE0009060CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Building Technologies OfficeLocation(s): NYOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Syracuse University (SU) to develop a whole-building retrofit solution for single-family attached residences. The solution would incorporate a variety of energy efficiency technologies and processes. These would include a novel building envelope retrofit system, an envelope-integrated heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, and a retrofit protocol and designdecision-making platform. Various laboratory-scale components (e.g. envelope paneling, HVAC components, sensors, etc.) would be fabricated, assembled and subjected to performance testing. A full-scale envelope prototype would also be developed and used for field testing.
