Use the list of organisations to help you promote Payroll Giving in the workplace, whether using a professional fundraising organisation, staff champions or a chosen charity.

The list does not include all approved Payroll Giving agencies, only those that ask to be included. Some agencies restrict services to particular employers and do not take on other employers.

Approved agencies that are not listed here will be able to produce a letter of approval from HMRC if required by employers.
