This document sets out the terms of reference for the non-statutory Digital Markets Unit, which will be set up in the Competition and Markets Authority.

The Unit will begin to operationalise the key elements of the UKâ€™s regime to unlock competition in digital markets for the benefit of UK consumers and businesses.

The government will consult on the form and function of the statutory Digital Markets Unit this year, and legislate to put it on a statutory footing as soon as parliamentary time allows.
