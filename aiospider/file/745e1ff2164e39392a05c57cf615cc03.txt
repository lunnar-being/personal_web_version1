Award Number: DE-EE0009115CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6, B3.15Advanced Manufacturing OfficeLocation(s): MAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Veloxint Corporation to critically evaluate physical and performance characteristics of bulk metal components manufactured from a nano-crystalline chromebased powder alloy, Veloxint Fortified Chrome (VFC). This alloy would be tested for the potential to be used for fabrication of aircraft engine compressor blades and, in turn, more simple applications. The project would be completed over 3 Budget Periods (BPs), with a Go/No-Go decision point between each BP. This NEPA determination is applicable to all 3 BPs.
