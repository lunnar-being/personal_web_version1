    Events Research Programme - Science
  

  
  

  
    
  Events Research Programme (ERP) is building evidence on the risks associated with COVID-19 transmission routes, the characteristics of events and surrounding activities, and mitigation measures that can effectively address these risks.

          Details


          

    
            
The objectives of the Events Research Programme (ERP) are to build evidence on the risks associated with COVID-19 transmission routes, the characteristics of events and surrounding activities, and the extent to which mitigation measures can effectively address these risks.

The ERP pilots are running across a range of settings, venues, and activities so that findings can support the reopening of similar settings across multiple sectors. The scientific research being conducted as part of the programme focuses on three types of study, the results of which will be published in the coming weeks.

The page brings together the Science Board Statement, conflicts of interest and protocols on which the studies will be based, along with general information on the programme.
