Cabinet and Cabinet Committees are groups of ministers that can take collective decisions that are binding across government. The Cabinet is the supreme decision-making body in government, dealing with the big issues of the day and the government’s overall strategy. Cabinet Committees reduce the burden on Cabinet by enabling collective decisions to be taken by a smaller group of ministers. The composition and terms of reference of Cabinet Committees are a matter for the Prime Minister.
