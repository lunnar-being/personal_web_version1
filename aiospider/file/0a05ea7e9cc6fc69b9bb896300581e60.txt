Purpose of this guidance

The purpose of this guidance is to set out the conditions under which the ESFA will pay the high value course premium (HVCP) in the 2021 to 2022 academic year and the 2022 to 2023 academic year.

Introduction

The Government’s Industrial Strategy sets out a long-term plan to boost productivity by backing businesses to create good jobs and increase the earning power of people throughout the UK with investment in skills, industries and infrastructure.

Education and skills are key components to addressing national and local productivity challenges, making sure individuals have the skills needed to meet the needs of the new economy. On 31 August 2019 the Chancellor announced an additional £400m of funding for 16 to 19 education. The announcement included the following statement:

“Colleges and school sixth forms will also get £120 million to help deliver expensive but crucial subjects such as engineering which lead to higher wages and, ultimately, a more productive economy.”

This guidance covers how approximately half of these funds will be allocated to providers to encourage and support the study of specific subjects that generate higher wage returns and are also identified in the Industrial Strategy as a priority. There will also be an increase in some programme cost weightings (PCWs) to recognise additional costs. This is covered in separate guidance.

The purpose of HVCP is to support the sector to grow the number of students studying selected substantial level 3 study programmes (including T Levels) in selected A level subjects or Sector Subject Areas (SSAs). These subjects have been selected using data on earnings outcomes and on their relevance to the UK Industrial Strategy as a way of indicating which will help to develop a more productive economy.

The policy intention is that providers utilise this funding, to encourage an increase in enrolments in substantial level 3 programmes that include these priority subjects and SSAs to build their capacity to deliver these programmes to more students to a high standard.

Qualifications attracting the HVCP

The criteria for selecting the qualifying qualifications are that they must be:


  approved for 16 to 19 study programme funding during at least part of the relevant academic year
  an A level in one of the following selected subjects



  
    
      Qualifying qualifications
    
  
  
    
      Biology
    
    
      Chemistry
    
    
      Computer science
    
    
      Design and technology
    
    
      Electronics
    
    
      Further mathematics
    
    
      Mathematics
    
    
      Physics
    
    
      Statistics
    
  



  or a level 3 qualification (other than an A level) with recommended GLH of 360 or more in one of the following selected Sector Subject Areas (SSAs). From 2020 to 2021 academic year this will include those T Levels in the relevant SSA



  
    
      Qualifying qualifications
    
  
  
    
      SSA 2.2 - Mathematics and statistics
    
    
      SSA 4.1 - Engineering
    
    
      SSA 4.2 - Manufacturing technologies
    
    
      SSA 4.3 - Transport operations and maintenance
    
    
      SSA 5.2 - Building and construction
    
    
      SSA 6.1 - ICT for practitioners
    
  


These qualifying subjects and SSAs were selected because they both have higher earnings outcomes according to available data and contribute to the UK Industrial Strategy. A level subjects and non-A level subject areas have been considered separately in this process. This way of selecting programmes identifies those most likely to contribute to a more productive economy.

2021 to 2022 allocations

The list of qualifying qualifications for HVCP allocations is based on qualifications approved for funding each relevant academic year. For 2021 to 2022 allocations we took the qualifications from those approved for funding for all or part of 2019 to 2020.

2022 to 2023 allocations

We have published the qualifying qualifications that we will use to calculate HVCP for 2022 to 2023 allocations. We have taken the qualifications from those approved for funding for all or part of 2020 to 2021.

The HVCP does not pre-empt or anticipate the outcome of the ongoing review of post-16 qualifications at level 3 and below.

The HVCP funding is allocated to qualifications currently funded by the ESFA and eligibility for HVCP funding does not mean that a qualification will or will not continue to be included on the ESFA’s list of qualifications approved for funding for 16 to 18 year olds in future.

We review the 16 to 19 funding methodology in advance of each academic year; funding is subject to spending review allocations and all funding rates are subject to change annually.

Students eligible for the HVCP

Students eligible for ESFA 16 to 19 study programme funding, both full and part time, can attract the premium. To attract the premium students will also need to be enrolled on a qualifying level 3 study programme, defined as follows:


  qualification must be on our published list of qualifying qualifications

  an academic study programme consisting of at least 2 of the selected A levels*

  a study programme with a core aim of a qualifying level 3 qualification in the selected SSAs with recommended GLH  of 360 or more
  from 2020 to 2021 academic year a T Level in one of the selected SSAs


*A level double awards are treated as 2 A levels. AS level double awards are not counted

Calculation and payment

Funding rate

We review funding rates annually. We will pay the rate below, per year the student is on their study programme or T Level.


  2022 to 2023 - £600
  2021 to 2022 - £400


Calculation

We will calculate HVCP as follows:

Step 1 - Identify students eligible for the HVCP.

Step 2 - Calculate the amount of HVCP per institution by:


  multiplying the total number of eligible HVCP students per institution by the funding rate


Examples of students eligible or not for the HVCP and how the allocation will be calculated can be found at Annex A.

For 2020 to 2021, we based the allocations on full year ILR/HESA/Census data from the 2018 to 2019 academic year. The data sources used in subsequent years are published on our 16 to 19 allocations page.

Payment

We pay funding through mainstream 16 to 19 allocations for each academic year, through the usual monthly profile. We will take infrastructure changes such as mergers and demergers into account as far as practicable in calculating the eligible amounts.

HVCP and the advanced maths premium (AMP)

The HVCP operates in parallel to the advanced maths premium. Students may qualify for both if they meet the respective criteria for funding.

Monitoring
We will continue to monitor HVCP to ensure that it does encourage increased participation and attainment at level 3 in these specific sector areas and subjects.

As part of ESFA’s ongoing monitoring, we will continue to contact providers where data, audit or other feedback indicates that they are operating outside of normal study programme rules.

The government will work closely with the sector to evaluate and review this approach to make sure it is delivering improved outcomes for young people and is incentivising colleges and sixth forms to offer valuable technical and vocational courses.

The HVCP in future academic years

Subject to monitoring, we expect the qualifying criteria setting out which subjects and SSAs are in scope will apply to identifying relevant qualifications in future. We will update the list of qualifications annually to reflect the qualifications approved for funding in the relevant year.

Funding guidance

Further information can be found in the 16 to 19 funding regulations and the rates and formula funding guidance.
