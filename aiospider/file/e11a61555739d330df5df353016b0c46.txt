In our previous , we provided an overview of what companies are doing during the COVID pandemic to stabilize or even improve their organizational health.

Programs that employed all four quadrants of the model were 3.6 times more successful compared to those who employed none across various contexts. We feel confident in assuming that the importance of each quadrant is even greater in times of world-wide turmoil.As a real-life example, we can look at what interventions companies have been putting in place to encourage three sets of behaviors: doing things differently, protecting the core, and motivating through meaning, across the influence model.As we move into a stage of reimagining culture in light of COVID-19, the influence model can be a powerful and practical framework to ensure leaders are driving change holistically. The power of framework lies in driving change across all four quadrants, consistently. While the need to do things differently, protect the core, and motivate through meaning are the focus of leading companies now, the influence model should be considered an enduring staple of your organization’s change management approach.
