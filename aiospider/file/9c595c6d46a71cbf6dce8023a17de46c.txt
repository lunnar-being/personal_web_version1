This competition looked for innovative, replicable large scale energy storage solutions which could provide a market competitive alternative to conventional commercial large scale energy storage technologies, for example pumped-hydro or batteries (such as lithium ion, lead acid or sodium-sulphur). Innovative large-scale energy storage will play an important role in decarbonising industry, power, heat and transport.

Successful projects:


  CRYOBattery led by Highview Power
  Whitelee Hydrogen Production & Storage Facility led by ITM Power and BOC


The Storage at Scale competition is closed for new applications. Details of the competition’s aims and objectives can be found in the competition guidance.
