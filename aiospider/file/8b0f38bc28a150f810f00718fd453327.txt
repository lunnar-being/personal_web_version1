To meet point 1 of the Technology Code of Practice (TCoP) your plans must show you understand your users and their needs.

If you’re going through the spend control process you must explain how you’re meeting point 1.


The Central Digital and Data Office is currently collecting feedback on the Technology Code of Practice. The aim is to improve the content and make sure it meets user needs. If you want to add your feedback, please complete this short survey.


How user research will help your programme

Doing user research will help your technology project or programme by identifying:


  any risks to introducing or changing the technology
  the skills needed to deliver, use and manage the technology
  the technologies that service support teams will need for their end users
  the commercial and operational needs, for example, the need to decommission an obsolete mainframe in order to create a more resilient data and service tier


User research can also:


  make sure that services such as online office suites, network shares, project management software and HR suites really do meet your users’ needs
  support internal agreement of what you want the technology to help you achieve



Next: Technology Code of Practice point 2 - Make things accessible and inclusive
