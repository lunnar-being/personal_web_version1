The 2021 national curriculum assessments, including key stage 1 tests and teacher assessments, have been cancelled.

Arrangements for 2022 will be published in the autumn term.


The key stage 1 (KS1) assessments data collection is a statutory data collection that takes place each June. You must complete statutory data collections by law unless there’s a good reason not to.

Local authorities must submit KS1 assessments for all state-funded schools, including academies and free schools.

You should submit teacher assessment information for all pupils at the end of KS1 for:


  reading
  writing
  mathematics
  science


You can find guidance on how to collect this information in section 8 of the KS1 assessment and reporting arrangements (ARA).

KS1 covers years 1 and 2.

You’ll need to:


  register and log in with DfE Sign-in

Please contact your school or local authority approver, if:


  you want to request a DfE Sign-in username or password so you can access COLLECT

  ‘key stage 1 assessments data’ is not on the list of collections you can see in COLLECT
