Award Number: DE-EE0009375CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): IDOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to Boise State University to model and test a binary particle size distribution combination of particles (i.e. particles of two different sizes) that would improve the overall heat transfer for packed bed heat exchangers. Additionally, they would use off-the-shelf equipment to develop a contactless technique for characterizing thermal conductivity of particles.
