1.2	Whether officers of the South Yorkshire Police and/or the West Midlands Police sought to deflect responsibility and accountability from the South Yorkshire Police, rather than establishing the truth of what occurred, by setting out to establish a false narrative of the events leading up to the tragedy and the causes of the injuries and deaths, including by:

(i)	officers deliberately and falsely setting out to blame the Liverpool football club supporters for the tragedy, by manufacturing and/or exaggerating evidence, and pursuing lines of inquiry and investigations directed and aimed at proving fault on the part of supporters, without regard to the  truth or merits or the lines of inquiries and investigations; and/or

(ii)	constructing and/or furthering this false narrative by deliberately manipulating and ignoring or marginalising lines of inquiries and investigations that suggested / had the potential to suggest fault on the part of South Yorkshire Police officers; and/or

(iii)	concealing and/or deliberately ignoring evidence that tended to undermine this false narrative and/or intimidating and cajoling witnesses to amend their evidence and accounts to accord with this false narrative, and/or fabricating and/or manipulating evidence and other materials provided to inquiries and investigations set up to investigate the tragedy to accord with this false narrative, including the investigation conducted by the Second Defendant into the actions of the First Defendant.
