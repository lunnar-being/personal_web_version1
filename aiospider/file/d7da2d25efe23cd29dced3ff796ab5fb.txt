The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) worked with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Secretariat as part of the Accelerated COVID-19 Economic Support (ACES) programme. Established in June 2020, the programme aims to support partner governments to respond to the pandemic. It has helped governments to coordinate their economic policy response, secure economic stability and protect jobs, and maintain the supply of essential goods and services.

In ASEAN, the FCDO worked with delivery partners to consult the ASEAN Secretariat and develop strategic options for 4 priority global value chains:


  textiles and apparel
  automotive
  medical technology
  consumer electronics


These are all vital to ASEAN’s post-COVID-19 economic trajectory.

This report sets out the analysis and offers a way for ASEAN member states to create an opportunity out of this global disruption, and emerge stronger than before. It is the result of work funded by the FCDO and carried out by Boston Consulting Group, in consultation with the ASEAN Secretariat.
