Award Number: DE-EE0008904CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6, B5.15Bioenergy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): COOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Colorado School of Mines (CSM) to apply directed evolution, genetic engineering, and natural selection strategies to algal strains in order to adapt strains to specific outdoor culturing conditions (e.g. high light intensities, O2 levels, salinity, pH) and improve lipid yield. Algal strains would be analyzed, and down-selected for further research. Strains determined to have targeted traits would then have the strategies discussed above applied to them.
