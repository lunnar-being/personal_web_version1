Solar (and wind) power is essential for a decarbonizing power sector. But it is intermittent. Matching power supply to demand will require more than 300 GW of grid-scale storage, including lithium-ion batteries. Fortunately, projects to build more than 200 GW of battery storage have applied to connect to US grid operators as of the end of 2020, signaling a rapidly growing market.
