This guide is for British citizens travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa or permit.

Entry requirements

If you’re going to Slovakia to work (or any other EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) you must make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements.

On the day you travel, you’ll need your passport to both:


  have at least 6 months left
  be less than 10 years old (even if it has 6 months or more left)


If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attend business meetings. These are usually covered by the Schengen visa waiver.

If you’re going for other types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.

Slovakia’s authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.


You must always check with Slovakia’s government before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements


If you’re working in more than one country you’ll need to check the entry rules of each country.
If you need a passport, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.

Visa and permit documents

This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in Slovakia. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.

It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with Slovakia’s embassy or immigration authorities.

You must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:


  translated
  
‘legalised’ (apostillised) or notarised
  originals, or if copies are acceptable
  signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)
  dated within a certain period of time, such as 90 days before you submit your application


Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa.

This guide uses the same terms used in Slovakia, so you know which ones to use when speaking to Slovakia’s authorities.

Check if you need a visa or permit

You don’t need a visa or permit if you’re travelling to Slovakia for up to 90 days in a 180-day period for:


  running or attending job interviews
  going to court as witness
  attending trade fairs
  attending board meetings
  meeting clients or customers (including entertainment like eating at a restaurant)
  meeting colleagues, contractors or sellers
  fact-finding visits
  negotiating, signing or executing deals or contracts
  attending, speaking or presenting at a conference
  studying
  attending entertainment functions
  team-building activities
  supervising the work of a vendor or contractor
  supervising or managing a team
  completing internal audits for your company
  follow-up work after a business meeting
  leisure travel, such as holidays or visiting friends or family


These activities are covered by the Schengen visa waiver.

Border checks
At the border, you may be asked to show:


  proof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets
  health insurance that covers your entire stay
  proof of accommodation for your entire stay
  enough money for the duration of your trip
  an invitation letter from your employer explaining your trip


Register with the Slovakian police

If you plan to stay for more than 72 hours (even as a tourist) you must complete a notice of stay form. You give this to the ‘Foreign Police’ or post it to them within 3 days of arriving in the country.

If you’re staying in a hotel or rented accommodation the accommodation provider will do this for you.

Check Slovakia’s exemptions

Certain types of work and activities do not require a visa or permit because they’re exempt. 
All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.

You may not need a visa or permit if you’re in Slovakia for up to 90 days because you’re:


  working in international transport services
  delivering goods or services as part of a commercial contract
  carrying out installation work, a warranty service or repairs under a commercial contract
  programming, installing or setting up a system under a commercial contract
  receiving or providing professional training under a commercial contract
  carrying out seasonal work in agriculture, forestry, fishery, industrial production, construction or in accommodation and catering services
  lecturing
  working as a professional sportsperson
  providing healthcare services
  volunteering
  working as a journalist accredited in Slovakia
  working within the scope of an international treaty
  working for a company registered as a significant investor in Slovakia by the Ministry of Economy
  an executive of a company
  a member of the armed forces or rescue team
  posted (transferred) by an EU-registered company


You may not need a visa or permit if you’re in Slovakia for up to 30 days in a year if you’re:


  an artist taking part in an artistic event
  working in science, education and learning and taking part in a scientific event – such as researchers, sociologists, chemists, and teachers


You’re allowed to have an employment relationship, but it can’t be for more than 30 days.

Notifying the labour office

If you’re working for a company in Slovakia they need to notify the local labour office by:


  submitting an information card
  providing proof of your accommodation in Slovakia


They need to do this in person or by post within 7 days of you starting work.

Register with the tax office

Companies that don’t have a registered branch in Slovakia but want to provide services there under a commercial contract should check if they need to register for VAT in Slovakia.

They have to do this before their employees can start working.

Show proof of exemption

You need to be able to show proof that you’re exempt to the authorities on request. This could be:


  an employment confirmation
  a contract such as a commercial contract
  proof of required qualifications, such as a diploma and professional certificates


Further checks
If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from Slovakia’s embassy or immigration authorities.

Applying for visa or permit

This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit to help you prepare, but you’ll need to check the exact rules and processes with Slovakia’s immigration authorities or embassy.

Taking your family

If you have a family they can join you as dependants with all of the permits listed in this guide.
