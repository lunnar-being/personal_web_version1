Following the London 2018 Commonwealth Cyber Declaration, the UK government implemented a series of projects to help Commonwealth countries improve their cyber security capacity .

This document explains work towards platforms to share information on cyber security domestically, regionally and globally, and across sectors. It aims to enable businesses and other organisations to share useful information, and better digest and act on information they receive.

This is one pillar of Citi’s official partnership in the UK government’s Commonwealth Cyber Declaration Project. It uses examples from  8 countries: Barbados, Kenya, Jamaica, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Trinidad & Tobago, Uganda.
