Although overall sentiment regarding the future is positive (more optimism than pessimism), there has been a slight deterioration in this outlook over the past three weeks.The exhibits below are based on a survey conducted April 5, 2020, with data included from previous surveys conducted on March 22 and 29, 2020. We surveyed US financial decision makers aged 18 years or older who are the sole or a joint decision maker with respect to their household finances. We will update these exhibits as we continue to monitor sentiment.
