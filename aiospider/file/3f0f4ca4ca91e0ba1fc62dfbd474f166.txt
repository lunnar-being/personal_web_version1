U.S. homes and commercial buildings consume a staggering 40% of the country’s total energy. To help decarbonize the built environment without sacrificing occupant comfort, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Building Technologies Office (BTO) has awarded $8.6 million to accelerate the commercialization of 20 research projects through a recent laboratory cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) call.“We cannot meet clean energy goals without addressing building technology,” said Erika Gupta, acting manager of the BTO Emerging Technologies program. “This investment will accelerate the commercialization of U.S. building technologies and create new, clean energy jobs for Americans in construction, skilled trades, and engineering professions.” The 2021 BTO Laboratory CRADA Call leveraged the expertise of its national laboratories by funding collaborative projects that involve one or more national laboratories and non-lab partners. The awards announced today will fund the following projects across six areas of interest (AOI):Awardees were selected based on peer review by outside scientific experts. Projects announced today are selections for negotiation of financial award. The final details for each project award are subject to final negotiations between DOE, national labs and project partners.  BTO develops, demonstrates, and accelerates the adoption of cost-effective technologies, techniques, tools, and services that enable high-performing, energy-efficient, and demand-flexible residential and commercial buildings in both the new and existing buildings markets. For more information about BTO initiatives, visit the .
