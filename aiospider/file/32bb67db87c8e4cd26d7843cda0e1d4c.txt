Through its grid-interactive efficient building (GEB) research, BTO seeks to build on existing energy-efficiency efforts and develop technological capabilities to optimize the interplay between building loads and the electric grid. This report focuses on dynamic window and opaque envelope technologies. Dynamic building envelope technologies include, for example, electrochromic glazing, automated attachments, and thermal storage. These technologies are in contrast to static high-performance building envelope technologies such as highly insulating windows.
