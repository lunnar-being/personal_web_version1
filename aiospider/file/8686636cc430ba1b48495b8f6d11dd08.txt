Effort to Tackle the Climate Crisis









“This is a case where conscience and convenience cross paths, where dealing with this existential threat to the planet and increasing our economic growth and prosperity are one and the same. When I think of climate change … I think of jobs.”
President Joe Biden Before Signing Executive Actions on Tackling Climate Change, Creating Jobs, and Restoring Scientific Integrity (
Jan. 27, 2021
)










On Day One, President Biden rejoined the Paris Agreement, restored U.S. leadership on the world stage, and reestablished our position to tackle the climate crisis at home and abroad. Days later, he took 
executive actions
 to ensure we tackle the climate crisis at home and abroad – all while creating jobs and growing our economy. And each day since, he has taken decisive action to reduce emissions, advance environmental justice, and create good-paying, union jobs.





President Biden formed the first-ever 
National Climate Task Force
 — mobilizing every agency to prioritize acting on climate change throughout the entire federal government. From curbing emissions, strengthening resilience, protecting public health, advancing equity, conserving lands and waters, and spurring economic growth, combatting climate change is central to every mission across the United States government.  





The President also convened the first-ever 
Leaders Summit on Climate,
 a historic gathering of more than 40 world leaders that affirmed the need for unprecedented global cooperation and ambition. The President also organized a leader-level convening of the U.S.-led 
Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate
 and 
pledged to quadruple our international climate finance
. On the road to COP26 in Glasgow and beyond, President Biden will continue rallying the rest of the world to step up, underscoring how strong domestic action goes hand-in-hand with international leadership.





President Biden has set ambitious goals to lead by example in tackling the climate crisis and delivering economic benefits at home:





Reducing greenhouse gas pollution from 2005 levels by 50-52% in 2030 as part of the U.S. 
Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)
Creating a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035
Reaching net-zero emissions economy-wide by no later than 2050





The 2020s is a decisive decade for the world to confront climate change and avoid the worst and irreversible impacts of the crisis by keeping the goal of 1.5 degree Celsius limit on global average temperature rise within reach. And the countries who take urgent and decisive action will reap the economic and jobs benefits of the clean energy future.





President Biden knows this, which is why he has taken clear action to create a more resilient, equitable, and prosperous future, building on past U.S. leadership of states, Tribes, and Territories, and local governments. And with his 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal
 and 
Build Back Better Agenda
, his efforts would be supercharged with the transformational investments that unlock the full economic and climate potential of his agenda.






















President Biden’s 
Leadership in Action 









 Through executive and regulatory actions, public-private partnerships, international diplomacy, and more, President Biden is working towards achieving his bold goals while taking steps to grow the economy, create jobs, and build a clean energy future – all while rallying the world to step up too. 





Reducing Emissions and Accelerating Clean Energy





 President Biden mobilized a whole-of-government effort to look at all sectors of the economy and take direct actions that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, accelerate clean energy production and deployment, and create good-paying jobs that strengthen the economy.
