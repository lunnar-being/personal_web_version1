          Details


          

    
            
The countervailing duty on biodiesel from Canada and USA was imposed by the EU on behalf of the UK and the other member states. The Secretary of State for International Trade transitioned the countervailing duty to continue applying in the UK after the transition period.

A transition review of the anti-dumping duty was initiated on 11 August 2020 under Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) case TS0005.
