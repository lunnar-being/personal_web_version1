Award Number: DE-EE0009020CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6, B5.15Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): GAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to the Georgia Institute of Technology (GA Tech) to design, develop, and validate setting-less relaying algorithms to provide reliable protection and control in a cyber-secure manner for distribution systems with high penetration of solar photovoltaic (PV) and other distributed energy resources (DERs). The proposed project aims to result in the development of an autonomous, adaptive and Secure Distribution Protection (a2SDP) system to meet various protection challenges created by extra high penetration of these resources.
