Award Number: DE-EE0008926CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Bioenergy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): CAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to University of California, Berkeley (UCB) to develop a Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) cycle to produce polyketide synthases (PKSs). PKSs are enzyme complexes that are used to turn sugars into a variety of compounds. UCB would seek to demonstrate the utility of using PKSs for the production of one commodity chemical (caprolactam) and two novel materials precursors (2-allylcaprolactam and 2- benzylcaprolactam).
