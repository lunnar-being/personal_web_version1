The Contracting Forum builds on last year’s GII Johannesburg Roundtable on the same topic, where industry leaders aligned on the need to continue the discussion and move the industry towards piloting collaborative contracts in Southern Africa. During the day together, we will do a deep-dive into the mechanics of collaborative contracting, discuss how-to setup an owner’s organization success, and determine which digital tools to support the process. We will also apply the lessons contained in a just released report, , to identify which steps will help Southern Africa transition toward more collaborative project delivery.
