This Defence and Security Accelerator (DASA) competition is run on behalf of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl).

This call is looking to generate novel technologies and techniques that can rapidly be developed to deliver life-saving protection against IEDs, while being adaptable to evolving technologies and able to operate in an increasingly congested electromagnetic spectrum.

The total funding for Phase 1 is £1.5m.

Bookable one to one dial ins for this competition are available on Wednesday 6th May 2020, where you will be able to discuss the Invisible Shield competition with technical members of the competition team. You can register for an event on Eventbrite.
