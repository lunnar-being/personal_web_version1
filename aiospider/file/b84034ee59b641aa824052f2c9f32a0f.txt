Most financial decision makers in Singapore view the current economy as neutral or weak and expect it to remain the same or worsen in the next three months. Half of consumers are concerned about their job security and most have eight months or fewer in savings to live off. Most consumers feel banks are performing per expectations and would like them to waive late fees on credit card and loan payments. Contactless payments has seen an increase in usage, and many consumers claim they will be using mobile and online banking services more often even after the crisis ends.
