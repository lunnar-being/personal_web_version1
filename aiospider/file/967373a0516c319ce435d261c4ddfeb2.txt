This guidance is for operators with an environmental permit for radioactive substances activities on nuclear licensed sites. It explains the conditions in radioactive substances regulation (RSR) permits for:


  receiving and disposing of radioactive waste on and from nuclear sites
  tenants who keep or use unsealed radioactive sources on nuclear sites


Operators that keep or use mobile radioactive apparatus should also follow this guidance on keeping or using sealed sources, where relevant.
