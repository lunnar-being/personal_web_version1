Developing and deploying energy storage capabilities will be critical to building a clean-energy economy and reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. The Department is helping the U.S. become the world leader in new storage technologies through its support for efficient, scalable manufacturing processes and robust supply chains.With this funding opportunity, DOE will partner with industry to address technical and manufacturing challenges that have prevented flow battery systems from achieving cost targets and commercial viability. DOE seeks proposals for collaborative, multi-stage R&D projects that improve manufacturing processes for individual flow battery components and integrate those new or improved components into a prototype system with a mid-sized capacity for grid, industrial, or transportation applications.Projects selected will:DOE anticipates making four to six awards.A minimum cost-share of 20% for R&D projects is required. Concept papers are due on April 29, 2021, at 5:00 p.m. ET. For additional details, including application and submission requirements, . Interested applicants may wish to  on April 1, 2021.Funding for this opportunity will be provided by the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy’s . Additionally, DOE’s  will support testing for selected projects at facilities like the  This $75 million research facility, based at , will boost clean energy adaptation and accelerate the development and deployment of long-duration, low-cost grid energy storage.The Flow Battery Systems Manufacturing funding opportunity is part of , a Department-wide program to accelerate the development, commercialization, and utilization of next-generation energy storage technologies and sustain American global leadership in energy storage.
