     in unconscious bias training—both employer provided and individually sourced
    about underrepresented groups across the full spectrum of diversity
Actively listen
     for honest and respectful dialogue between people from underrepresented groups and others about bias and mistreatment (for example, when listening to others talk about their experiences, try not to get defensive or focus too much your own feelings)
     to learn about colleagues’ different cultures and experiences
Advocate and mentor: 
    (for example, if they are of a different race, gender, age, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic class) to ensure that you are contributing to a more inclusive support system
     and create stretch opportunities to support their development
Speak up: 
     for contributions, ideas, and work
    , especially when you observe discrimination (privately and/or publicly) against those from underrepresented groups 
    without getting defensive
Enlist others
     in getting more involved with gender and racial equality and antiracism efforts
     that cater to all attendees (for example, consider dietary preferences and whether events are family friendly)
     in email signatures or other digital tools (for example, videoconference displays)
Educate and share resources
     about training, development, promotions, sponsorships, and mentorships 
     on labor laws and procedures to empower yourself in the workplace
