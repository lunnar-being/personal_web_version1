Building on the McKinsey Global Institute’s , which analysed physical climate risks and their socioeconomic impacts, McKinsey Sustainability recently undertook a global, human-centric analysis of population exposure to multiple climate hazards. In the below infographic, we are sharing a preview of some of the key insights in advance of the important discussions taking place during Climate Week NYC this week. Our research shows that climate hazards are a near-term humanitarian challenge. The threat of climate change is not only increasing at an accelerated pace, but also does not develop linearly. Instead, it jumps forward in bigger steps, affecting people, communities and economies unevenly around the world. The impact of these hazards is borne disproportionately by people in the most vulnerable third of the world’s population, who are twice as likely to be exposed to climate hazards. This analysis emphasizes the imperative to build resilience by highlighting the scale of the global challenge we face. For more, read our full analysis on the impact of climate change on communities and populations,  which provides important insight on a roadmap for building climate resilience.
