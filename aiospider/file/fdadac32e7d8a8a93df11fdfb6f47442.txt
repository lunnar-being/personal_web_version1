Gasoline direct injection (GDI) is a fuel delivery technology that improves combustion by spraying fuel directly into the cylinders where it can mix with air. This results in improved fuel economy and engine performance. Engines equipped with GDI first appeared on the market in 2007, and by 2008 they were installed in 2.3% of all light-duty vehicles produced. Ten years after introduction, GDI was used in about half of all light-duty vehicles produced. Preliminary data show that in 2020, GDI installations have continued to rise, reaching a new high of 55.3%.* Data for 2020 are preliminary. Includes cars, pickups, and cargo vans less than 8,500 lbs. gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR), and sport utility vehicles and passenger vans up to 10,000 lbs. GVWR.
