This handbook sets out the main activities for conducting inspections of independent schools that are commissioned by the Department for Education outside of the normal inspection cycle. These inspections are known as ‘additional inspections’: pre-registration inspections of proposed schools under section 99 of the Education and Skills Act 2008, and material change, progress monitoring and emergency inspections under section 109(1) and (2) of the Education and Skills Act 2008.

This handbook also covers welfare-only additional inspections of independent schools, conducted under the Children Act 1989.

It sets out the purpose of each type of additional inspection and explains the judgements that inspectors will make and on which they report.

This handbook also sets out how inspectors evaluate schools’ action plans to rectify regulatory failures.
