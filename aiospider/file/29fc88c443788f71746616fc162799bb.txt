Today, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) released a Request for Information (RFI) to identify the challenges and opportunities posed by the widespread implementation of energy-management systems that use smart manufacturing technologies.Improving the efficiency of energy-intensive processes at manufacturing facilities is a fundamental step on the path to industrial decarbonization. Structured energy-management systems, such as those aligned with the global International Organization on Standardization (ISO) 50001 standard, .Smart manufacturing technologies, including advanced sensors, controls, software platforms, and data analytics, allow manufacturers to further optimize their use of energy and materials. However, the adoption of energy-management systems that use smart manufacturing technologies is uneven across the industrial sector and geographic regions.Through this RFI, DOE’s Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) seeks feedback from industry, academia, research laboratories, government agencies, utilities, energy-efficiency program administrators, and other stakeholders on:DOE is specifically interested in energy efficiency programs that could provide training and technical assistance on smart manufacturing and energy-management systems to manufacturers with limited capabilities. Responses to this RFI will inform DOE’s research and development portfolio for materials and manufacturing process technologies that support energy savings and cost reduction goals.DOE’s   issued this RFI. Responses are due no later than 5:00 p.m. ET on July 30, 2021. Interested stakeholders can view the full RFI and submission guidelines .
