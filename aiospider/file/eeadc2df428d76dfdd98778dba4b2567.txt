This guidance is to support breast screening providers, commissioners and other partners in identifying and reducing inequalities throughout the breast screening pathway.

It includes information and resources on how to:


  identify inequalities
  reduce inequalities


This guidance includes recommendations from a research project, funded by the Department of Health and Social Care through the Health and Wellbeing Alliance, to identify why some people from groups experiencing marginalisation and exclusion do not attend breast screening, and how to improve the experiences of those who are.

Many thanks to the following groups, who worked with Public Health England (PHE) on that project:


  Faith Action
  Friends
  Families and Travellers
  Latin American Womenâ€™s Rights Service
  Macmillan
  Association of Mental Health Providers on behalf of the Mental Health Consortia
  Race Equality Foundation
  The Lived Experience Alliance
  The National LGB&T Partnership


Examples of initiatives to tackle breast screening inequalities have been shared via the PHE Screening Blog. Please contact the PHE Screening helpdesk if you have an example of practice we could share with other providers.
