Award Number: DE-EE0009335CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): COOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Sinton Instruments to develop a new method for evaluating silicon solar cells to characterize them at the end of the production line. A tool would be developed to bin and sort cells (i.e. ensure that those of the same electrical nature are used together in a particular module for optimal performance).
