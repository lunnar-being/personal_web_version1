          Details


          

    
            
On behalf of the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD), DASA is running a Market Exploration to explore potential technology that would improve MOD’s ability to monitor and improve power quality. This market exploration looks to identify technologies of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4 and above or those below TRL 4 that are likely to mature within a year.

Whilst potentially successful technologies and concepts may be exploited within any future acquisition programmes, please note that this request for information is not a commitment to subsequently launch a formal DASA competition.
