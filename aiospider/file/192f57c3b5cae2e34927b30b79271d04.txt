CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.2Geothermal Technologies OfficeLocation(s): NVOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) through an interagency agreement (IAA) to support airborne LIDAR, magnetic, and radiometric data acquisition in western Nevada and eastern California. The Area of Interest (AOI) covers approximately 56,000 sq. km. The airborne surveys would be used to map topography and geophysical signatures of exposed and concealed rocks for use in the identification of hidden geothermal resources and the development of associated exploration technologies.
