On February 8, Hicks made history as the first woman to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate as Deputy Secretary of Defense.  Hicks grew up in a military family and understands what it is like to have a career of service. "I know what the sacrifices are for family members," she said. "And I want them to know that when I get up and come into work now, all of that is at the forefront of my mind. I'm thinking about how we really deliver for them every day, how we use taxpayer dollars, … effectively, to make sure they're as ready and as capable as they can be."
