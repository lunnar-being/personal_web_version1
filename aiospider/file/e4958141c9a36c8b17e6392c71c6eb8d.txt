Recent manufacturing and fabrication efforts for advanced light water reactors (ALWRs) in the United States have highlighted the need for new technologies and infrastructure to reduce production costs. To enable cost-effective development and deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs) and advanced generation nuclear units, the U.S. industry must consider advanced manufacturing/fabrication technologies and methods. This proposal presents a Modular In-Chamber Electron Beam Welding (MICEBW) approach that can be used to join large-diameter, thick-section components such as reactor vessels, steam generators, and pressurizers.
