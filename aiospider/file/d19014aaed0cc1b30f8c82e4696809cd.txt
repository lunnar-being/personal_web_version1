          Details


          

    
            
The Biomass Feedstocks Innovation Programme aims to increase the production of sustainable domestic biomass by funding innovative ideas that address barriers to biomass feedstock production. It will support those who are seeking to improve productivity, through breeding, planting, cultivating and harvesting.

The programme is separated into 2 lots:


  lot 1 - innovation projects
  lot 2 - multi-site demonstrator


The programme forms part of BEIS’ £1 billion Net Zero Innovation Portfolio, which aims to accelerate the commercialisation of innovative clean energy technologies and processes through the 2020s and 2030s.


Applications to the Biomass Feedstocks Innovation Programme are now closed

£4 million in funding has been given to 25 organisations to develop strong project proposals that will deliver commercially viable innovations in biomass production.

We have published details of the successful projects.
