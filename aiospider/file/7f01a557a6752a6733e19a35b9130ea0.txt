Award Number: DE-EE0009249CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Fuel Cell Technologies OfficeLocation(s): CAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to University of California Irvine (UCI) to develop and test a novel solid oxide fuel cell device for use in the production of direct reduced iron (DRI). A prototype system would be developed which would interface a Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell (SOEC) system with a computer-based setup designed to simulate a traditional DRI furnace. The project would be completed over three Budget Periods (BPs) with a Go/No-Go Decision Point in between each BP.
