Award Number: DE-EE0009006CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.2, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): CAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) to design, fabricate and field test two cost-effective remote sensing technologies to monitor avian fatalities at utility-scale solar facilities: fixed platform (Animal Activity Monitoring-AAM) and aerial-based (Unmanned Aerial System-UAS). Project work would occur at EDM International Inc. (Fort Collins, CO) and the Southwest Research Institute (SWRI â€“ San Antonio, TX). Both AAM and UAS field trials as well as UAS pilot testing would occur at the Blythe Solar Power Project and McCoy Solar Energy Project near Blythe, CA and the California Valley Solar Ranch near Santa Margarita, CA. The project would be completed over two Budget Periods (BPs), with a Go/No-Go Decision Point in between the BPs.
