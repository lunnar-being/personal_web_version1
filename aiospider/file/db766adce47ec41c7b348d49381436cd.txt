Did you know that women make up more than  of the cybersecurity workforce? While men still outnumber women in cybersecurity by three to one, more women are joining the field – and they’re pursuing top leadership roles. At CESER, we’re committed to breaking down barriers and empowering women and girls to pursue careers in STEM and take on leadership roles in the field. Today, there are plenty of successful women in cybersecurity that serve as positive role models and possibly even mentors by women hoping to break into and succeed in the field. We’re proud that some of those role models are right here at CESER.Check out our spotlights on women leaders at CESER below! #IDWGS
