Award Number: DE-EE0009066CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Building Technologies OfficeLocation(s): MAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to Fraunhofer, USA, Inc. (Fraunhofer) for the development and demonstration of an integrated process using prefabricated insulated Panel Blocks (PB) to reduce the on-site labor and installed cost of delivering high-performance exterior wall retrofits for low-rise residential buildings in cold, very cold, and mixed humid climates. Design refinement work would occur at H. C. Fennell Consulting in Vermont while fabrication and demonstration of the PBs would occur within Fraunhoferâ€™s facility in Brookline, Massachusetts. Budget Period 1 (BP1) would focus on demonstrating the integrated high-performance wall retrofit process on a mockup wall with critical design features of most residences that impede the scalability of exterior wall retrofits.
