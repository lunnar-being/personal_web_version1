The Defense Department's enduring mission is to provide combat-ready forces to deter war and protect the security of the United States. One of the ways DOD maintains the competitive edge of its troops is through a diverse system of research and development laboratories.DOD laboratories design new tools for cyber defense, evaluate new concepts for autonomous vehicles and advance military-critical technology in areas such as advanced computing, "big data" analytics, artificial intelligence, autonomy, robotics, directed energy, hypersonics, and biotechnology.Some of this innovative work was on display during the third biennial DOD Lab Day at the Pentagon. Lab Day is a chance for DOD to showcase the work being done by its scientists and engineers to benefit warfighters.The Air Force Research Laboratory showcased its hypersonic flight research that includes achievement of a major milestone: completing the critical design review of the X-60A liquid rocket. It will now move to the fabrication phase. In 2020, the X-60A will be airdropped in its first flight test.
