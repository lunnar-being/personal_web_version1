HMCTS has been rolling out video conferencing technology to Crown Courts in England and Wales to enable some criminal hearings to be held by video. The cloud video platform (CVP) system connects securely to the existing justice video network, which links police stations and prisons to courts. It is accessible by any internet-enabled device with a camera and a microphone.

CVP is also being rolled out to magistrates’ courts, and to civil and family courts.

The final decision about using video technology in any legal hearing is always taken by the judge, magistrates or panel, and only when they believe it to be in the interests of justice.
