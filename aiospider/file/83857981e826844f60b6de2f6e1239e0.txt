These training materials will help HE institutions understand:


  acceptable use policies (AUPs) and the need to have them make specific reference to the statutory duty
  how institutions should consider the use of filters as part of their overall strategy to prevent people being drawn into terrorism
  the need for clear policies and procedures for students and staff working on sensitive or extremism-related research
