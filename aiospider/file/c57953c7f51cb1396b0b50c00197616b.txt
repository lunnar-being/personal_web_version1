          Details


          

    
            
Ethnic minority employment bulletins provide Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) and employers with up to date information, articles, research and case studies, as well as strategic and practical advice about ethnic minority employment. They are published every 3 months.

We have also published ‘Local Enterprise Partnerships and BME workers: A practical guide to addressing skills challenges’ with guidance on initiatives that LEPs can adopt to address the ethnic minority employment gap.
