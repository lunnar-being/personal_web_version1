On behalf of the National Institute of Justice, the RAND Corporation, in partnership with the Police Executive Research Forum, RTI International, and the University of Denver, is carrying out a research effort to assess and prioritize technology needs across the criminal justice community. Since 2015, the Priority Criminal Justice Needs Initiative (PCJNI) has published more than 20 reports identifying and prioritizing criminal justice needs for innovation. Participants in all PCJNI efforts were selected based on their professional experience and expertise in an effort to assemble a distinguished group of experts reflecting different types of criminal justice agencies and civil society and technical organizations for the topics being considered.
This product includes a Microsoft Excel database that contains summaries of all of the PCJNI's published studies and captures all of the needs for criminal justice innovation resulting from these studies. It also includes a brief technical report describing the database and providing summaries of the needs within it. The database provides three different tools for selecting and reviewing needs, including a navigable, collapsible outline, a visualization tool for selecting needs through push-button menu options, and a standard Excel table with filters. The database also includes Excel PivotTables and PivotCharts for users to create their own displays of needs by study, applicable technology, and priority. As new studies are published, the database will be updated.
