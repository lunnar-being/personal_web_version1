Six books have been chosen for the 2020  shortlist, which was announced today in London by McKinsey senior partner  during a virtual event hosted with FT editor .“In a year when books were often an escapist respite and as many business ideas felt abruptly outdated, the 2020 shortlist reflects a rich diversity of mainstream books that not only look back, but also offer enduring and relevant lessons in resilient leadership,” Dame Vivian said. “They are potential guides on how to rewire companies, organizations and societies for the post-pandemic next normal.”Three of the six books focus on individual companies, two offer big-picture looks at capitalism, and one outlines the way technologies will recast our world of work. This year’s shortlisted authors include a Nobel Prize winner, a CEO, university professors, journalists, and an economist. The inspiration for one book came to authors during summer days at a cabin in Montana; another, from decades-old company records in the archives of MIT.“A good shortlist should include books that are provocative, well-written, with compelling character studies, ones that also offer lessons and remedies that inspire readers to reframe contemporary, essential issues,” said , McKinsey global publishing director and one of eight members of this year’s jury. “These six cover that gamut, but—more importantly for this extended pandemic moment in all our lives—they also stand the test of time, especially in the role business can and should play in how the next normal shapes up.”A judges panel will select a winner of the award and the £30,000 prize that will be presented in London on December 1; runners up will receive £10,000.Here’s a look at some of the most compelling business reading this year:By Sarah FrierThis book traces the extraordinary rise of Instagram from a storytelling app to a cultural force that shapes the way we eat, entertain, dress and live, and along the way, created the new “influencer” industry.By Reed Hastings and Erin MeyerIn terms of culture, Netflix breaks a lot of rules.
