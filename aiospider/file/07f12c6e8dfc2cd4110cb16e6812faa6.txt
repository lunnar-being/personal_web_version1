The UK government selects open standards for use in government technology. The aim is to apply these consistently across government bodies, making our services more integrated and better for users.

These profiles include the open standards chosen by peer review and public comment through the Open Standards for government process.

The Open Standards Board endorsed the first set of open standards for government technology in September 2013.
