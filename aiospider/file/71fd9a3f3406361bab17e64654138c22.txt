The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), as the MOD S&T category manager, has established strategic S&T framework agreements for use across government.

These frameworks are an efficient way for UK government to engage science and technology suppliers and for suppliers to become part of the UK government S&T supply chain.

Dstl work with industry including small and medium-sized enterprises and academia to help deliver the science inside UK security and defence.

Each of the frameworks covers a specific area of science and technology; some are sub-divided into lots. Each framework or lot is managed by a lead contractor. The frameworks are:


  Analysis for science and technology research in defence (ASTRID) framework
  Electronic warfare and cyber (EW&C) framework
  Human social science research capability (HSSRC) framework
  Progeny maritime research framework (PMRF)
  Serapis framework, covering C4ISR (command, control, computers, communication, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance), space systems, synthetic environments and simulation technology
  Weapons sector research framework (WSRF)


Dstl also uses a dynamic procurement system called R-Cloud to match suppliers’ capabilities and skills to our requirements. Register to join the R-Cloud at any time.
