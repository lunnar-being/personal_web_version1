The Statement of Public Participation (SPP) sets out how and when we will engage with stakeholders during the marine planning process.

An SPP is required for each marine plan area under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009. It helps ensure that the marine planning process is transparent, and that stakeholders understand how they can be involved and can influence a marine plan’s development.
