About Blood borne virus unit (BBVU)

BBVU is a joint PUblic Health England (PHE) and NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) unit. The unit works closely with the Clinical Services Unit (CSU) and provides specialist reference testing for the hepatitis viruses. The unit undertakes surveillance, research and development activities for hepatitis A virus (HAV) through to hepatitis E virus (HEV), and also for pathogens that impact on blood safety.

Services available

BBVU provide reference services for:


  
HAV RNA detection and phylogenetics
  hepatitis B virus (HBV) sequencing genotyping and phylogenetics
  
HBV antiviral resistance testing by sequencing
  screening for HBV surface antigen mutations by sequencing
  screening for HBV pre-core and basal core promoter mutations by sequencing
  hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotyping and phylogenetics
  hepatitis D virus (HDV) RNA detection and quantification
  
HEV RNA detection and quantification
  
HEV genotyping and phylogenetics
  outbreak or transmission investigation for HAV, HBV, HCV and HEV



Use form:


  S10 for HBV sequencing requests
  S14 for enhanced surveillance of acute HBV infections (genotyping and avidity analysis)
  S1 for other hepatitis investigations


Further information on other hepatitis investigations is available through the Clinical Services Unit (CSU).


BBVU surveillance activities

Activities include:


  national programme undertaking molecular characterisation of viruses linked to food-borne and travel related HAV infections (includes oral fluid testing to identify cases)
  enhanced surveillance of acute HBV (avidity testing to confirm diagnosis with linked molecular characterisation and phylogeny)
  monitoring of HBV vaccine breakthrough infections in infants with linked virological characterisation of HBV-infected mothers
  enhanced surveillance of HEV infections (monitors hepatitis E case numbers nationally with linked molecular characterisation and phylogeny)
  rolling programme undertaking molecular characterisation of BBVs (HIV, HBV and HCV) in identified infected blood donors
  
HEV seroprevalence studies in blood donors.
  unlinked anonymous survey in People Who Inject Drugs



BBVU research and development activities

Activities include:


  
HBV surface antigen phenotyping studies
  development and application of genomic technologies for HBV and HEV

  establishment of in vitro based models for studying HBV and HEV

  investigating prevalence, immunological determinants of persistence and outcome of chronic HEV infections in the immunosuppressed population
  development of tools for investigating indigenous HEV infections (recombinant protein expression and monoclonal antibody production)
  programme of studies investigating HEV and the food chain
  development of Ebola antibody and antigen detection systems for convalescent plasma studies; development of antibody detection assays for Zika
  development of detection methods for non-venous analytes to improve diagnosis
  investigating the role of HEV antigen detection; development of HEV antigen neutralisation
