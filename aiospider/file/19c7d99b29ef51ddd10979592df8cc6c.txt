Award Number: DE-EE0009367CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): NJOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey to develop and characterize a deionized ozonated oxide (DI-O3) layer for application on solar cells. This would be tested for performance related to growth rate, uniformity, reproducibility, defect density, pinhole density, and film integrity. Based on these results, a DI-O3 layer would be applied and tested on passivated contact (PC) structures to exhibit that DI-O3 can be used as a tunneling film in PC silicon and thin film solar cells.
