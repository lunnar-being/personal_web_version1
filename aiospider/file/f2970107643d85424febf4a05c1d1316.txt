 This post shares reflections on best practices when standing up a global legal operations function, drawing inspiration from how we’re tackling Legal’s goals within the context of McKinsey’s broader mission and purpose.The role and importance of legal operations has undergone a significant transformation in the last decade. While the trend began with practice groups and operations management within law firms, legal operations has now emerged as a core hub in corporate legal departments, as well as an academic focus in several law schools who have begun to add legal operations and management courses to their curriculum.Across contexts, the emerging goal remains the same: to transform the legal community from a back-office function to a core business partner.Highlighted below are some intrinsic aspects McKinsey’s legal department has learned along the way through best practices and real-time experience.In 2019, McKinsey’s in-house legal department embarked on a transformation designed to meet our firm’s evolving needs and aspirations globally. Our organizational structure—including a legal leadership team across regions and central internal functions—and a newly established legal operations role, focus on driving three overarching goals for the department that align with McKinsey’s overall purpose:Legal technology has become a core element of in-house legal departments that professionals can have at their fingertips. However, suboptimal technology—or amazing technology improperly leveraged—can be a time and effort drain on an otherwise high-functioning department. With our colleagues spanning 47 countries, McKinsey’s legal team has focused on making sure our technology processes are targeted, strategic, streamlined, and accessible to all from a centralized location.Additionally, knowledge is key to the success of a growing department, both in terms of helping clients find the support they need and helping legal professionals leverage existing expertise. In order to effectively recruit and retain talent, we invest in continued learning for all of our colleagues, whether it’s through substantive training programs, apprenticeship and mentoring, or day-to-day, real-time experiences to establish best practices.With our legal department being so widespread, staying connected—especially during the COVID-19 pandemic—is an objective we continue to keep at the forefront. This connectivity includes breakout sessions on hot topics across practice areas, industry alerts, substantive legal topics, and team building through informal virtual get togethers. In addition, we’ve led quarterly sessions on practical skills such as communication, problem solving, presenting with impact, and negotiations workshops.In 2020, we brought diversity and inclusion to life in a more formalized way by launching the “Legal Inclusion & Impact (I&I) global initiative.” We hold sessions on allyship, conscious inclusion, and panel dialogues on race and cultural diversity to highlight how we can continuously learn about other cultures and be inclusive in our day-to-day involvements. We have hosted external speakers and have also had our own colleagues speak specifically on their unique characteristics and perspectives, giving the global department a very real view into our colleagues’ lives that is both wonderful and challenging.On the intellectual thought leadership front, we established our “McKinsey Legal Speakers Forum” with guest speakers to share their valuable insights with our department colleagues.The future state of McKinsey Legal is an ever-changing landscape that spans innovation, design thinking, use of machine learning, and sustained cultural evolution throughout the firm. We plan to continue leveraging technology to make McKinsey Legal even more efficient, letting our global expertise soar while staying focused on the mission, values, and purpose of our firm.
