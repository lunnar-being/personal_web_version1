As permafrost thaws because of global warming, viruses and bacteria that have lain dormant in soils for centuries . Many of these viruses likely will be dangerous for humans and animals and do not have readily available vaccines for treatment.

One Health, which was launched in 2013 out of the Arctic Council's Sustainable Development Working Group, is a laudatory effort to bring a cross-disciplinary approach to health and wellness across the Arctic region by holding knowledge-sharing events and mock exercises to bring together health and science professionals specializing in the circumpolar North.And yet, despite this early start on crisis-related cooperation, the severity of the coronavirus pandemic demonstrates that One Health's work, in isolation, is not enough.
