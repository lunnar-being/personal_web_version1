Award Number: DE-EE0009019CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): CAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) to develop solar photovoltaic (PV) facilities models (i.e. algorithms) for incorporation into commercial software tools. These models would enable utilities to plan, operate, and protect transmission and distribution systems when integrating behind-the-meter solar PV systems and distributed energy resources (DER) into their energy platforms. EPRI would also demonstrate applications for the PV models, including automated assessment and adaptive distribution protection schemes. Protection schemes would then be tested at field locations with high solar PV penetration and/or microgrids.
