Conceptual schematic of transformational grid-resilient heating system technology for residential and commercial buildings.Gas Technology Institute, Des Plaines, IL  -- Oak Ridge National Laboratory – Oak Ridge, TN-- Sheetak Inc. -- Austin, TX$1,143,259 $287,500 April 15, 2019 – July 31, 2022 Building Energy Efficiency Frontiers and Innovation Technologies (BENEFIT) - 2018The project’s overall objective is to develop a highly efficient, grid-independent, self-powered, fuel-flexible, and drop-in capable integrated Advanced Burner Thermoelectric Generator (ABTEG) system for residential and commercial buildings. At the end of this project, the system will demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of a system capable of operation without the use of external electrical power that can be further applied to other building heating technologies.Research on developing highly efficient, self-powered appliances for grid independence have not resulted in commercially successful products due to low energy savings and customized designs preventing drop-in installation. The proposed project plans to address these challenges. The project leads to 1.5 quads/year of energy savings with a heat pump, drop-in, self-powered, grid-resilient system with more than 70% reduction in NOx emissions and 21.2 Mt of CO reduction annually.
