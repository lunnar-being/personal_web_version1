The ‘Ethics, Transparency and Accountability Framework for Automated Decision-Making’ is a 7 point framework to help government departments use automated or algorithmic decision-making systems safely, sustainably and ethically. It is aimed at civil servants, particularly: 


  senior owners of all major processes and services subject to automation consideration
  process and service risk owners
  senior leaders
  executive leaders
  operational staff
  those in digital, data and technology (DDaT) roles
  policy makers
  ministers when considering an algorithm or automated system


The ‘Ethics, Transparency and Accountability Risk Potential Assessment Form’ document will help teams assess the possible risk of an automated or algorithmic decision.
