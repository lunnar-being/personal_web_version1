          Details


          

    
            
This licence lets you hold biological samples (including blood, DNA and other tissue) from birds and wild animals taken as part of an investigation if you’re a laboratory or scientific institution.

You can only hold onto the sample during an investigation into offences under part 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act.

You do not need to apply for this general licence but you must meet its conditions and follow its instructions.
