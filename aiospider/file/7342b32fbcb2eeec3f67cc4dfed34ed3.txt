          Details


          

    
            
These draft contract documents cover remote advice in the following categories of law:


  discrimination
  education.


The draft contracts consist of the following elements:


  contract for signature
  standard terms
  specification
  further documents.


Contract for signature
The contract for signature is the document which gives effect to the contract as a whole. The sample contract for signature has been published for illustration purposes only as contents such as any special conditions vary between providers.

Standard terms
The standard terms govern the commercial relationship between Legal Aid Agency (LAA) and the provider.

Specification
The specification sets out the rules for providing and being paid for CLA contract work. It is divided into provisions of general application (Sections 1 to 6) and category specific rules for education and discrimination (Section 7).

Cases and hourly rates annex
The cases, fixed fee and hourly rates annex sets out the payment structure for contract work. The specific fees and rates paid will be in accordance with the provider’s tender bid.

Payments and disbursements annex
The payments and disbursements annex sets out the process for submitting claims and being paid for controlled work under these contracts.

Information technology (IT) requirements, Case Management System (CMS) and Business Continuity annex
The IT requirements, CMS and Business Continuity annex sets out the IT systems and other related processes the provider must have in place. These include data security and business continuity requirements.

Key performance indicators (KPIs)
The KPI annex sets out the KPIs we expect providers to meet and explains the consequences of breaching these requirements.

Complaints annex
The complaints annex sets out the specific complaints policy the provider must have in place for clients to use. It also provides information on the way that complaints will be handled by the provider and the LAA.

Unacceptable behaviour
The unacceptable behaviour annex sets out an established process for dealing with unacceptable behaviour by CLA clients. It ensures that this behaviour is handled fairly, proportionately and consistently across the CLA service.
