You know how to move from analysis to synthesis and/or design intent. Such skills include: demonstration of the ability to apply logical thinking, gathering and analysing information and evidencing key performance indicators (KPIs).
  
Experience of using tools and software. You have worked with industry-standard software, such as: Adobe creative suite, presentation software, social media platforms, animation software. You have knowledge of printing techniques and paper stock.
  
Experience of working within constraints. You understand and can work within given constraints (including but not limited to technology and policy, and regulatory, financial and legal constraints).

You know how to talk to developers and know when to switch code. You understand security, accessibility and version control. You can use ‘what you see is what you get’ tools.
  
Prototyping. You can apply technical knowledge and experience to create or design workable prototypes, both programs and physical outputs. You understand parameters, restrictions and synergies.
  
Strategic thinking. You can take an overall perspective on business issues, events, activities and discuss their wider implications and long-term impact. This could include determining patterns, standards, policies, roadmaps and vision statements. You know how to focus on outcomes rather than solutions and activities.
  
User focus. You understand users and can identify who they are and what their needs are, based on evidence. You can translate user stories and propose design approaches or services to meet these needs. You can engage in meaningful interactions and relationships with users. You put users first and can manage competing priorities.
