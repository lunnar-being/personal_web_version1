On behalf of the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) Naval Ships Support Central Engineering Team, DASA is running a Market Exploration to identify available hybrid powertrain technologies, at Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) 5-9, for implementation into service by 2030. The purpose of this Market Exploration is to gain an understanding of what is currently available in the market regarding hybrid powertrains for ships, that meets the capability requirements of Defence Equipment and Support (DE&S). Royal Navy Ships and Auxiliaries have long development times; any potential solutions need to be adaptable for retrofitted to existing and future platforms.
This exploration will allow a better understanding of what is currently available for use and what approaches we can take in future steps.

Please note that this request for information is not a commitment to subsequently launch a formal DASA competition.
