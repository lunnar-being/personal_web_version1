Science and innovation underpin the economies of both UAE and the UK. Encouraging work between the two countries therefore produces benefits for both.

To promote international collaboration the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office jointly fund the UK Science and Innovation Network based in 30 countries around the world.
