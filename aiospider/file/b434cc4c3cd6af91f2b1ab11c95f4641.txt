          Details


          

    
            
This licence allows you to survey white-clawed crayfish (also called Atlantic stream crayfish) by:


  hand
  hand net
  dropped net (if you stay with the net)
  crayfish trap (to operate traps lawfully you will also need permission from the Environment Agency)


You need a separate licence for any other activities.

Register with Natural England

Before you can use this licence, you must register with Natural England using the application form linked on this page.

When you need to pay

It costs £80 to register for a new CL11 licence.

From January 2022, it will cost £35 to renew your registration.

You must declare the intended use of the licence on your registration form. This will determine if you need to pay, such as to survey white-clawed crayfish for development projects.

Natural England will refund unsuccessful applications.

Read the terms and conditions for paying for a wildlife licence.

When you do not need to pay

You do not need to pay if the licence is used for:


  voluntary purposes - any work you do is unpaid and you are registered with an organisation or charity as a volunteer
  conservation, science or research purposes - research related to the protected species is carried out by a student or employee of an academic institution or research body


How to pay

You can pay using a bank card. Follow the GOV.UK Pay link on the application form.

References

  have not held a licence for the species or a similar species for the last 3 years
  have a licence but want to add new methods


Report action taken

You must complete the survey return form by 31 January each year, even if you’ve taken no action or did not find target species. You’ll need the names of any accredited agents who carried out the surveys on your behalf. 
You must send your results to the Local Record Centre. You can do this by recording your results on the iRecord website or contacting your local record centre.
