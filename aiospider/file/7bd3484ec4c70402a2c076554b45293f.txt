Award Number: DE-EE0009370CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): VAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) to develop a prototype self-monitoring and diagnosing technology for photovoltaic systems to reduce energy production losses. The technology would use algorithms to identify specific faults and power degradation trends of the photovoltaic (PV) components and instantly alert operations personnel of the need for corrective action. The technology would be demonstrated in the existing rooftop PV system of the Virginia Tech lab.
