Consider these ingenious innovations that can transform our buildings:  These are just a few of the many technologies getting closer to commercialization thanks to this year’s + cohort, a Department of Energy (DOE) technology-to-market program focused on building technologies funded by the Building Technologies Office and implemented by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. IMPEL+  translate the premise and promise of their work into the language of business, boosting their chances of bringing their technologies to market.IMPEL+ stands for Incubating Market-Propelled Entrepreneurial Mindsets at the Labs and Beyond. Participants from business, academia, and DOE’s national labs hail from every region of the country —  from Alaska to Massachusetts. The program has trained 125 Innovators since the program began in 2019. They have ranged in age from their 20s to their 70s since the program started in 2019, and over half have been women and people of color. This underscores the IMPEL+ vision for inclusive innovation­ in finding new creative solutions to overcome technological, regulatory, and market challenges in the highly diverse built environment. As this year’s cohort closes, it is incredible to see all the successes these entrepreneurs have achieved.“How we build today, sustainably, will transform the course of history. That is why we invest in our IMPEL+ Innovators, providing them coaching by top Silicon Valley professionals, and technical vetting by Berkeley Lab experts. We provide Innovators two  — one to climate tech incubators, and one to federal and state energy offices —  through which participants can earn prizes, pilot-project opportunities, fellowships, funding, and other support to drive their innovations toward commercialization,” said Reshma Singh, a Harvard-trained architect and the director of IMPEL+.IMPEL+ held three fully subscribed virtual Coaching Workshops. During these intense 10-hour days Innovators were live-coached by top Silicon Valley coaches to develop clear, compelling and succinct pitches.IMPEL+ Innovators pitched to federal and state energy leadership at two national “Shark Tank” style events in partnership with the Building Technologies Office, the Weatherization and Intergovernmental Programs Office, and the National Association of State Energy Officials.
