Debris from the cleanup is being transported outside the State of California for disposal at licensed commercial disposal facilities.“The Department of Energy is pleased to be making progress again at ETEC,” said William “Ike” White, Senior Advisor for Environmental Management to the Under Secretary for Science. “DOE will continue to work with the state to advance cleanup at the ETEC site.”ETEC, located in Area IV of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory, served as a premier research facility from the 1950s until the end of active operations. Since the 1980s, more than 200 structures on the site have been demolished and removed; after completing RMHF demolition, only eight DOE structures will remain.
