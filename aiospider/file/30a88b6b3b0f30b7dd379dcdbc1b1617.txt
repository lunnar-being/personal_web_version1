              1 June 2018
              Please note there is a new notification on the delay to the next Open Call cycle launch, with some recommendations on what to do next.
            
            
              25 May 2018
              We are making improvements to the DASA Submission Service, which means we need to delay the launch of Open Call Cycle 3. Open Call Cycle 3 will be available from midday on Monday 11 June 2018.

Because we are moving to a new system, we recommend you do not commence drafting proposals in the current Submission Service, but prepare them off line so they can be uploaded when Cycle 3 opens on our new system.
