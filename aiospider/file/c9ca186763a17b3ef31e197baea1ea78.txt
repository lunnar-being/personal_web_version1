Purpose

This information is for institutions selected to deliver T Levels. It explains how we fund T Levels. The scope includes funding for 16 to 19 year old students, and students up to age 24 who have an Education, Health and Care Plan. This information should be read in conjunction with the ESFA 16 to 19 funding guidance.

A T Level is a Level 3 study programme, which has been approved by the Institute of Apprenticeships and Technical Education under sections A2DA and A2DB of the Apprenticeships Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009.

How T Level funding is different from the way we fund 16 to 19 study programmes

We are building on the existing arrangements in order to distribute T Level funding for 16 to 19 year olds:


  4 new funding bands to accommodate the different sizes of T Levels
  funding based on the hours spread over 2 years because T Levels are 2-year programmes
  consistent funding for 18 year olds because T Levels have fixed hours
  industry placement funding at a flat rate of £550 with half paid in the first year and half in the second
  extra disadvantage funding to reflect the additional hours and demands of T Levels


Maths and English condition of funding

The condition of funding will apply to all students starting T Levels from academic year 2022 to 2023 in the same way as it does to students on 16 to 19 study programmes.

It will not apply to students who started T Levels in the academic years 2020 to 2021 or 2021 to 2022. However, we expect these students who have yet to achieve a GCSE grade 4 in English and/or maths to continue to work towards a Level 2 in these subjects.

Background

As set out in the government response to the T Level funding consultation published in June 2019 and supported by the majority of the respondents, we plan to build on the existing arrangements. This is in order to distribute T Level funding for 16 to 19 year olds, rather than design a new separate funding system, so that we can maintain a simple, fair, efficient and transparent funding system.

This will mean adjusting the current funding system so that it funds T Levels alongside existing 16 to 19 study programmes.

Funding formula for T Level funding

The diagram below shows the national funding formula for 16 to 19 funding, this has been slightly adjusted for T Levels. Each element of funding for T Levels that is either additional to study programmes, or where the rate or operation is different, is detailed below.



Student numbers

As T Levels were introduced in the 2020 to 2021 academic year, there is no historical delivery to determine how many students to fund for T Levels for the 2021 to 2022 academic year allocations. We do not want funding to be a barrier to the introduction of T Levels so we have therefore based the T Level student numbers on a planned figure pre-agreed with institutions.

For the 2021 to 2022 academic year we are using the T Level student numbers submitted by institutions in October 2020, based on planned recruitment in autumn 2021. Where necessary, as outlined in the section below, we will update this figure in autumn 2021 for any under or over delivery.

We will keep this approach under review and assess when the best point to apply lagged student numbers to future T Level funding years.

T Level students will, in the main, be students who would otherwise have taken existing 16 to 19 courses. Therefore, the funding of planned T Level student numbers will not affect an institution’s overall allocation of student numbers – only the bands in which they will be funded. The overall lagged student numbers approach, as calculated for any other academic year, will apply for 2021 to 2022 and will still be used as the basis for the allocation.

Only students enrolled with an eligible T Level provider can attract additional T Level funding.

Funding bands

T Levels will include more teaching hours and be more prescriptive in the content than study programmes, so we are adding 4 larger funding bands to the existing 5 bands. Table 1 illustrates the average and minimum planned hours, along with the funding rates for each of the bands.

The rates and hours shown throughout this document are for 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022.

Size of wave 1 T Levels and funding bands

The size of the first 3 technical qualifications were published in April 2020, the detail is available on the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (IfATE) website. In order to create the figures in the table below, we have assumed that 150, employability, enrichment and pastoral (EEP) hours, as outlined in the T Level funding consultation document, will also be completed in each T Level. This places the T Levels for delivery from 2020 to 2021 in the following bands.

For Education and Childcare:

For early years educators: there is an expectation that 100 additional hours should be delivered as part of the necessary observation on the industry placement. The additional 100 hours for this T Level only should be counted as ‘planned hours’ for purposes of institutions planning students’ programmes and completing the ILR / schools census.

The Education and Childcare Technical Qualification specification states,


Providers must:


  plan placements of 750 hours over the 2-year TQ delivery period
  ensure students complete a minimum of 415 placement hours, of which 100 must be guided learning hours on placement to reflect the time needed for students to develop the skills and knowledge required, and for formative assessment to take place to demonstrate success.



Once the 100 hours for the observation are added, the early years specialism of the Education and Childcare T Level, is above the minimum hours for band 6, and will be funded at band 6 from 2021.

The Assisting Teaching and Supporting and Mentoring Students in Education Settings specialisms, will be funded at band 6 from 2021 although, even after the EEP hours are included, the T Level is below the minimum 1100 hours for band 6. Therefore, institutions will need to ensure they deliver the minimum 1100 hours for band 6, by either adding additional qualification hours and/or EEP.

Size of Wave 2 T Levels and funding bands

The information at Table 3 shows the funding bands for wave 2 T Levels based on the latest information received from the Awarding Organisations for delivery in 2021 to 2022. To determine the funding band we also include 150 hours of Employability, Enrichment and Pastoral (EEP) support.

The final funding bands in subsequent years for these T Levels will be announced in due course, taking into account EEP and any additional requirements. If the T Level is then placed in a lower band than the one originally identified there would not be a change to the funding for 2021 to 2022 allocations. It will change from 2022 to 2023, including for a student’s second year, where they commenced in 2021 to 2022.

There are further wave 3 T Levels due to be delivered from 2022 to 2023 academic year. The funding bands for these will be published following finalisation of the size of the technical qualification.

Distribution of students across funding bands

Until lagged student numbers and funding factors are applied to T Level students, the current methodology for distributing lagged student numbers across the funding bands will not apply for the T Level students. Each T Level student will be placed in the appropriate band.

For example, if an institution has lagged students of 1,000 distributed across the funding bands as shown below, and the ESFA has agreed with the institution delivery of 80 T Levels in 2021 to 2022, the distribution across the funding bands will be as shown in table 5 below:

Planned hours and funding bands

If a student’s programme has a lower number of recorded planned hours (including qualification and employability, enrichment and pastoral (EEP)  than the minimum of 1100 hours for band 6- institutions will need to deliver additional EEPand/or qualification hours/teaching to meet the minimum hours for the band and record hours that meet the minimum.

If a student doesn’t meet the minimum hours, they will only receive funding for the existing study programme band 5. The planned hours recorded will be for the technical qualification and the non-qualification elements of the T Level. The non-qualification elements will not include hours for any maths and English delivery or the industry placement but it will include EEP. In this circumstance the planned hours total will be used to determine whether the planned hours fall below the minimum hours for a T Level.

We expect that institutions will deliver at least the minimum hours for all students. In exceptional circumstances it may be appropriate to offer less hours, for instance where a student has significant, relevant prior learning. In those instances, the appropriate planned hours must be recorded, and where the planned hours are below the minimum for the T Level we will fund at the appropriate lower band.

Where this results in the student being recorded in band 5, where all the components of the T Level are recorded, all the additional features of a T Level will be retained, such as no reduction in rate for 18 year olds and additional industry placement funding.

The retention factor

T Levels will be recorded as a 2-year programme, with retention calculated on an annual basis. When students are on a 2-year programme and they complete the first year, they will be counted as retained in that academic year. We define completing the first year as being in learning on the last working day in June. The same principle applies in the second year.

Transfers

To calculate funding factors and bands for future years, we will use the core aim that the student is recorded on at the end of the academic year. End year data will be used to identify what T Level the student is enrolled on. If during the first year a student transfers from one T Level to another, it will be the latest T Level aim that will count. Transfers from one T Level to another are not possible after the end of the first year.

Where the transfer is to a study programme, the planned hours recorded for the study programme will inform the distribution to funding bands for a future years’ allocation.

Where a student leaves the T Level during the year to start an apprenticeship or other programme outside 16 to 19 study programmes, usual retention principles will apply and the institution would lose 50% of the annual funding rate for that student, as the student will not be classed as having completed their learning aim.

Programme cost weighting (PCW)

There are 6 PCW factors in the 16 to 19 model from 2020 (increased from 4 in 2019 to 2020).

Table 6: PCW factors for 2020 to 2021

For 2021 to 2022 we will apply the same PCW as for study programmes. We will calculate the PCW from 2019 to 2020 data from the sector subject area (SSA) tier 2 classification of the core aim for students on vocational qualifications. Full details for the PCW by SSA for 2020 to 2021 have been included in the funding guidance page on GOV.UK.

How PCW will be applied from when T Levels will come under the lagged student number approach

We will continue to use PCW to recognise that some programmes are more costly to deliver than others.

16 to 19 study programmes generate a PCW based on the type of programme (many vocational programmes and some academic science programmes get a PCW) and the SSA of the programme’s core aim.

The qualification structure for T Levels is different from study programmes. Each T Level technical qualification is a broader qualification representing the core content of each of the 25 T Levels. The detail of each T Level is represented by the occupational specialist content that is chosen.

It is therefore not possible to apply PCW to T Levels in the same way as for 16 to 19 study programmes which have a single SSA for each core aim.

The approach detailed below has been developed in recognition that PCW should be applied at occupational specialism level.

We have worked with the Institute for Apprenticeships to produce a mapping of T Levels to Apprenticeship standards to apply a consistent link to SSA and PCW and allocate a single PCW to each occupational specialism.
Where occupational specialisms within a T Level map to more than 2 SSAs and PCWs, we have applied the majority PCW, that is the one that has most specialisms mapped to it.

To provide a simple and consistent way of applying PCWs that avoids overfunding some of the delivery within the specialism, we have applied the lowest PCW for the small number of specialisms that have 2 mappings i.e a Study Programme PCW, and a Occupational Specialism PCW.

Please note that whilst T Level programmes are funded outside the normal lagged funding system we will continue to apply your PCW calculated from your study programmes to both your study programme and T Level provision, until T Levels are brought into the lagged student number method. We will confirm when T Levels will be brought into the lagged student number method at a later date.

PCW for T Level transition programme

T Level transition programmes are linked to the T Level route, and so represent the high level sector area rather than an occupation as the T Level specialism does.

T Level Transition Programmes can be either qualification based or non-qualification based. We will apply PCW at the route level that the Transition Programme is aligned to so that PCWs can be applied consistently across both types of delivery method (qualification and non-qualification). In instances where the T Level PCW maps to multiple PCWs we have taken the average.

PCW for the T Level Transition Programme are applied on a lagged basis so will not affect funding allocations until 2022 to 2023.

The PCW applied to the T Level Transition Programme that will apply from the 2022 to 2023 academic year is available in the table below:

16 to 19 funding: Level 3 programme maths and English payment

This additional maths and English funding is provided to support the delivery of maths and English to those students on substantial level 3 study programmes (including T Levels) who have not yet attained a grade 9 to 4 GCSE or equivalent in either or both of these subjects.

The full details for how the funding will be applied is included in the guidance on GOV.UK.

Disadvantage funding

The disadvantage factor that we will apply to T Level students works in a similar way as for other 16 to 19 students, with 2 elements:


  block 1: economic deprivation, based on the home postcode of the student
  block 2: prior attainment in GCSE English and maths at age 16


Block 1: economic deprivation

Disadvantage block 1 funding is based on where students live, in order to determine whether disadvantage funding should be allocated and at what level. To do this we look up their home postcode in the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). The IMD is an official government index that tells us how deprived areas are, based on education, crime, health, employment, and income statistics. We then assign an uplift to those students who live in the 27% most deprived areas of the country. Details for how the factor is calculated are included in the 16 to 19 funding guidance.

The calculation of the overall economic deprivation factor is weighted based on individual students and their historic programme size. Because T Levels have more hours than students on study programmes, this factor is applied to a higher level of funding which means that the allocation will generate a higher block 1 funding amount.

Block 2: prior attainment

Disadvantage block 2 provides funds to support students with additional needs including moderate learning difficulties and disabilities. As a proxy for identifying these students we use low prior attainment in maths and English.

Low prior attainment is defined as not achieving English and/or maths GCSEs at grades A* to C or grades 9 to 4 by the end of year 11 (typically age 16).

Each instance of a student not having achieved a maths or English GCSE at grade C/4 or above is counted. This means that a student who does not have this grade in both GCSEs will be counted twice for the block 2 uplift. We will calculate block 2 funding for T Levels as part of the overall block 2 calculation for the institution. We will therefore multiply the T Level student number by the institution’s overall instance per student figure to determine the disadvantage block 2 funding for T Level students, in the same way as we do for full- or part-time study programme students.

The funding rate for block 2 disadvantage for T Level students will be £650, which is higher than for study programmes in recognition that this is a large, demanding programme and additional support will be needed for students with special educational needs and disabilities, including when they are on an industry placement.

      Total number of students
      Number of instances for maths and English
      Instances per student

      1000
      350
      0.35
      40
      14
    
  


Each instance will be funded at £650, so a T Level student, without both maths and English by the end of year 11, would attract £1300.

Large programme uplift (LPU)

We recognise that T Levels will be demanding programmes, however there could be a small number of students that will want to take an A or AS level alongside their T Level. We will provide funding for high attaining students who may want to take an A/AS level alongside their T Level through the LPU. T Levels are the only programmes where an AS level taken alongside can be eligible for the large programme uplift.

The large programme uplift is funded on a 3-year lagged basis, for 2021 to 2022 academic year it is calculated using historical data for attainment from 2018 to 2019 academic year. This data is used to identify the number of students eligible for the large programme uplift. This means students starting a T Level in 2021 to 2022 that qualify for the LPU when they complete it in 2022 to 2023 will attract additional funding in 2024 to 2026.

A/AS levels (excluding general studies and critical thinking) taken alongside T Level programmes may qualify for the large programme uplift.

A student must achieve a minimum merit grade on their T Level programme and minimum grade B on their A/AS level (or minimum grade C for further maths) to qualify.

Additionally, any A /AS levels taken alongside a T Level must offer demonstrable additional content that is relevant to the student’s programme and which is not already covered by their T Level qualification (including occupational specialism) content.

The uplifts for T Level programmes are paid for either 1 or 2 years depending on whether it is for an AS level or an A level, as indicated below.


  
    
      10% paid for 1 year
      A T Level programme with at least a merit grade plus one AS level (other than General Studies and Critical Thinking) at grade B or AS level further maths at grade C
    
    
      10% paid for 2 years
      A T Level programme with at least a merit grade plus one A level (other than General Studies and Critical Thinking) at grade B or A level further maths at grade C
    
    
      20% paid for 1 year
      A T Level programme with at least a merit grade plus more than one AS level (other than General Studies and Critical Thinking) at grade B or AS level further maths at grade C
    
    
      20% paid for 2 years
      A T Level programme with at least a merit grade plus more than one A level (other than General Studies and Critical Thinking) at grade B or A level further maths at grade C
    
  


It is very unlikely that a student would take an AS Level and an A level in different subjects as well as a T Level therefore, students taking a combination of AS and A levels will get the uplift appropriate to the qualifying A level(s) only.

Advanced maths premium

We are supportive of high attaining students who want to take core maths or maths A level alongside their T Level. The advanced maths premium announced in 2017, will mean there is funding for this where providers are expanding the number of students taking level 3 maths, including T Level students.

Funding industry placements within T Levels

Industry placements are a compulsory element of the T Level. Placements are to be delivered in line with the industry placements quality assurance guidance, due to be published later this spring. In the meantime, please see the published standards and principles that apply to industry placement Capacity and Delivery Funding. We will fund industry placements at £275 per student for each of the 2 years of the T Level. Payments will be allocated for the T Level student numbers agreed with providers.

Where a provider also has an allocation of the Industry Placement Capacity and Delivery Fund (CDF) a corresponding reduction will be made to the number of students funded through the CDF. For example, a provider with 100 places funded through the CDF and an allocation of 40 T Level students will be allocated placement funding for the 40 T Level students in their mainstream allocation and 60 places through CDF.

Under/over delivery against funded T Level student numbers for 2021 to 2022

Having set the allocation based on planned T Level student numbers, we will then use the first data return of the year (R04/2021 Autumn school census) from the Individualised Learner Record (ILR) and the school census, to assess actual enrolments.

We will compare enrolment numbers with the planned numbers included in the allocation and make any necessary adjustments to the allocation. We will also check the T Level student numbers recorded in R04/2021 Autumn school census against the final numbers recorded in year-end data (R14/2021 Autumn school census).

Business cases will not be accepted for changes to student numbers including where providers fail to submit accurate data in the R04 or Autumn school census.

There is no threshold for growth in T Level student numbers so in instances where institutions over recruit on their T Level student numbers; we will provide funding for all additional T Level students within each band.

In this circumstance a revision to the number of students in the appropriate band and corresponding reduction to band 5 numbers will be made. The allocation will be re-calculated and re-issued. The allocated student number will not be increased, and any increase in overall student numbers delivered will be dealt with through the exceptional in-year growth process.

      1000
    
  


There will be an under-delivery tolerance of 40%, of student numbers against each T Level funding band. If institutions under recruit on their T Level student numbers, as we recognise that institutions will have planned and committed expenditure for delivery of the T Level student numbers previously agreed.

Where under delivery is above 40% only the funding for students above 40% within each T Level funding band will be recovered.

For example, if an institution had 40 students in band 6 and under delivered by 15, T Level student numbers for that band would not be reduced as 15 students of 40 is less than 40%.

However, if they under delivered by 20 students in band 6 (which would be 50%) the number of students above the threshold (4) would be reduced in the T Level band 6 and the corresponding number of band 5 students will be increased.

This means that those students would revert to being funded as full-time band 5 students. Therefore, the difference in funding between band 6 and band 5 and the additional funding for industry placements, would be removed. Other additional funding that is paid for T Level students will also be removed including the additional funding that is only paid for T Level students.

If an institution fails to deliver any T Levels at all, as T Level funding was made upfront, all T Level funding will be removed from the allocation. To maintain the lagged student numbers included in the allocation, the T Level numbers will be replaced by full-time band 5 student numbers This will result in the  reduction in funds between the T Level band and band 5 being recovered from future payments.

The exceptional in year growth process will apply if recruitment to T Levels results in an overall increase in lagged student numbers This process is subject to affordability.

How to record T Levels

Below is a summary of the information institutions must return in their 2021 to 2022 data returns for T Level students. More detail can be found in the guidance published for the ILR and Autumn School Census data collections.

Every T Level programme must have the following mandatory components recorded in the data you return:


  
    T Level qualification – this is the regulated qualification representing the T Level core and specialist content. This must be recorded at the beginning of the T Level programme. T Level qualifications can be searched for on find a learning aim using the title “T Level technical qualification”. In the [Learning Aims Reference Service,] T Levels have a learning aim type of 1468 - T level technical qualification.
  
  
    T Level occupational specialism – every student must undertake an occupational specialism as part of their T Level programme. From 2021 onwards the occupational specialism dictates the level of funding a student attracts and so it is very important we can identify this from the data you return. Each occupational specialism has a learning aim in LARS and QWS starting with ZTLOS. This must be recorded at the beginning of the T Level programme.
  
  
    T Level industry placement – every student must complete a substantial industry placement as part of their T Level programme. A T Level industry placement is recorded using the learning aim ZWRKX003. A work placement entity record must also be returned for the industry placement. This can be recorded in the first or second year of the T Level programme.
  
  
    T Level programme aim – a programme aim is an overarching programme level learning aim that spans the whole programme and is used to calculate funding elements for the T Level programme. A programme aim is recorded using the learning aim ZPROG001. This must be recorded at the beginning of the T Level programme.
  
  
    T Level planned hours – we need to know how many hours are planned for each student for the whole programme. This is different to study programmes where you record the hours planned for each academic year.
  


We have set up separate planned hours fields for T Level programmes to ensure the different methods of recording planned hours do not get confused.

In the ILR T Level planned hours should be recorded in the planned hours (phours) field for the whole T Level programme against the T Level programme aim only.

In the school census T Level planned hours should be recorded in the T Level planned learning hours and T Level planned employability, enrichment and pastoral hours for the whole T Level programme

Coding components

Every learning aim in a T Level programme must be recorded with programme type 31. This indicates the learning aim belongs to a T Level programme.

If some components of a T Level programme are not coded correctly it could result in a student being assigned to an incorrect programme type and not being funded correctly.

From the academic year 2021 to 2022 framework and pathway codes must be returned for T Level students in the ILR. This will ensure validation can check the occupational specialism is compatible with the chosen T level qualification aiding you in ensuring your data recording is accurate.

This check is also performed by validation on the school census in a different way as the framework and pathway structure is not part of the school census collection.

Recording planned hours

Recording accurate planned hours in the correct fields is crucial in ensuring accurate funding is calculated. The table below shows which planned hours fields should be recorded for the different programmes a 16 to 19 student can undertake.


  
    
      
      Planned hours (Phours) / T Level planned learning hours and T Level planned employability
      Planned Learning Hours and Planned Employability, Enrichment and Pastoral hours
    
  
  
    
      Student only undertaking a T Level programme in the academic year
      Yes - hours planned for the whole programme
      No
    
    
      Student only undertaking a study programme (including T Level Transition Programme) in the academic year
      No
      Yes - hours planned for the academic year only
    
    
      Student undertaking a T Level programme and a study programme (including T Level Transition Programme) in the academic year
      Yes - hours planned for the whole T Level programme
      Yes - hours planned for the academic year for the study programme only
    
  


T Level planned hours must include:


  the technical qualification,
  specialist content, and
  non-qualification activity.


T Level planned hours must not include:


  maths and English delivery,
  industry placements, or
  other qualifications that are not part of the T Level.


Recording the core aim


  T Level programmes are vocational programmes that must have a core aim.


For every T Level programme the core aim must be the T Level technical qualification.

Recording occupational specialisms

From academic year 2021 to 2022 the occupational specialism will determine the funding band (and in future the programme cost weighting) the T Level attracts. To ensure accurate funding can be calculated throughout the academic year the occupational specialism must be recorded at the beginning of the programme.

In cases where a specialism has not been decided on at the beginning of the T Level programme you should record the occupational specialism that is most likely to be undertaken based on the planned programme. Should the student then start a different specialism to the one originally recorded you should remove the original occupational specialism from the students record and record a new specialism aim that reflects the specialist activity being delivered.

In the ILR when you change an occupational specialism you must also change the pathway code for all T Level learning aims.

Data migration

As the T Level technical qualification and the occupational specialism are key components in calculating funding they must be present in your data for each year of the programme. Therefore, all year 1 T Level learning aims must also be returned in year 2 (and any subsequent years) until the student completes their programme.

Check data accuracy

To ensure the accuracy of funding allocations, in-year monitoring and reconciliation you must ensure your T Level students are correctly recorded in your data returns.

The 16 to 19 funding reports in the funding information system, Submit learner data and COLLECT will identify your T Level students and the funding bands assigned to them.


  
    The 16 to 19 funding claim report (ILR) and 16 to 19 funded student summary report (census) have separate sections for study programmes and T Levels, the latter showing the total number of T Level students and the funding bands they are assigned to according to the T Level and planned hours you have recorded.
  
  
    The 16 to 19 Summary of funding by student (ILR) has a T Level student indicator and the Student detail report (census) is split into study programme and T Level sections showing you which students our calculation recognises as a T Level student based on the data you have returned.
  


Use these reports to ensure all your T Level students are correctly reported under the correct funding bands (T Levels should come under bands 6, 7, 8 or 9).

If some T Level students are not displaying as you expected, use this checklist to ensure you have recorded all programme elements correctly:

1: Have you recorded a valid T Level qualification?

2: Is the T Level technical qualification the core aim?

3: Have you recorded a valid T Level occupational specialism linked to the T Level qualification?

4: Have you recorded a programme aim (ZPROG001) spanning the delivery of all T Level components?

5: Are all the learning aims (including the programme aim) in the T Level programme coded programme type 31 (T Level?)

6: Is the T Level programme the latest programme recorded for the student?

7: Have you recorded T Level hours for the whole programme (and not annually)?

How to record T Level transition programmes

Only institutions who have been selected to deliver T Levels and who have confirmed they are delivering the T Level transition programme in the same T Level routes should record students on the T Level transition programme.

T Level transition programmes are a variant of 16 to 19 study programmes, linked to a T level route. The recording requirements are:


  All T Level transition programmes must have a programme aim (ZPROG001) - this must be recorded as aim type 1 (ILR only).
  All learning aims within a T Level transition programme should be recorded as programme type 30 (T Level transition programme).
  T Level transition programmes must be linked to the T Level route the student plans to progress to. In order to make this link, a T Level route level class code must be recorded in each T Level transition programme. There are 11 route level class codes which can be found in the Find a Learning Aim service by entering ZTPR* in the learning aim reference search box. This aim must be the core aim (aim type 5 in the ILR) of a T Level Transition Programme.
  Any other learning, including maths and English where applicable, is recorded as a component aim (aim type 3 in the ILR).
  As T Level transition programmes are a form of 16 to 19 study programme, you must record annual planned hours values in the Planned Learning Hours and Planned Employability, Enrichment and Pastoral Hours fields.
  You must not record hours in the T Level Planned Hours fields (the planned hours field in the ILR and the T Level Planned Learning Hours and T Level Planned Employability, Enrichment and Pastoral Hours fields) - these fields are only used for students undertaking T Level programmes.
  For an example of how a T Level transition programme should be recorded in your data returns, see here.

Audit and monitoring

T Levels, including their integrated industry placement, will be funded as an integral part of the 16 to 19 national funding formula and will be subject, on a sample basis to planned routine assurance reviews, alongside 16 to 19 study programmes. Our assurance review approach will be developed to focus on areas of funding risk and will supplement data validation or analysis work. Further details on the audit and monitoring approach for T Levels will be published as part of the mainstream audit approach.

Students that start their T Level part way through the year

We anticipate that students will commence a T Level at the beginning of the academic year. However there may be some students who have sufficient prior learning that the institution considers it is in the best interest of the student to join a group part way through the year rather than wait until the next year.

In these instances, the total planned hours for the length of the T Level should be recorded, and we will calculate the level of funding that will apply to those planned hours. This funding will then be spread over the length of the T Level programme in a similar way that applies to part year study programmes.

Students undertaking a T Level programme and a study programme in the same funding year

The ESFA will not fund students to take more than one full-time study programme or the equivalent in multiple part-time programmes in one institution in one funding year.

We expect students to be undertaking a study programme or a T Level programme in one funding year and not both.

If in exceptional circumstances a student does progress from a study programme to a T Level part way through the funding year they will be funded as per any other T Level student generating a full year’s worth of T Level funding in year 1 and in year 2.

If the student then continues their T Level into year 3 due to the late start in year 1 there will be no further funding for year 3.

Funding for T Level Transition Programme

Delivery of the Transition Programme is expected to be through the standard study programme funding system and rates as set out in the T Level Consultation (November 2018) and the Government response (June 2019).

It will therefore be important for institutions to record the correct core aim for T Level Transition Programme students, as set out in the Provider Support Manual and the school census.

              8 December 2021
              We have updated a section on the maths and English condition of funding. The condition of funding will apply to all students starting T Levels from academic year 2022 to 2023 in the same way as it does to students on 16 to 19 study programmes. 

It will not apply to students who started T Levels in the academic years 2020 to 2021 or 2021 to 2022. However, we expect these students who have yet to achieve a GCSE grade 4 in English and/or maths to continue to work towards a Level 2 in these subjects.

              We have updated the how we fund T Levels guidance to include further detail on how T Levels should be recorded and the size of Wave 3 T Levels.
            
            
              5 July 2021
              We have updated the Programme cost weighting section to outline how we will apply PCWs to T Levels based on the occupational specialisms related to them.
