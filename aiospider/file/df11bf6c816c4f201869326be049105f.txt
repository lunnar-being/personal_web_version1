The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Health Canada, and the United Kingdomâ€™s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have jointly identified 10 guiding principles that can inform the development of Good Machine Learning Practice (GMLP). These guiding principles will help promote safe, effective and high-quality medical devices that use artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML).
