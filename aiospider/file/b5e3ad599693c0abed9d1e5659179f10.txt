This guide is for British citizens travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa or permit.

Entry requirements

If you’re going to Austria to work (or any other EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) you must make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements.

On the day you travel, you’ll need your passport to both:


  have at least 6 months left
  be less than 10 years old (even if it has 6 months or more left)


If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attend business meetings. These are usually covered by the Schengen visa waiver.

If you’re going for other types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.

Austria’s authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.


You must always check with Austria’s government before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements.


If you’re working in more than one country you’ll need to check the entry rules of each country.

If you need a passport, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.

Visa and permit documents

This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in Austria. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.

It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with Austria’s embassy or immigration authorities.

You must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:


  translated
  
‘legalised’ (apostillised) or notarised
  originals, or if copies are acceptable
  signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)
  dated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application


Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa.

This guide uses the same terms used in Austria, so you know which ones to use when speaking to Austria’s authorities.

Check if you need a visa or permit

You don’t need a visa or permit if you’re travelling to Austria for up to 90 days in a 180-day period for:


  running or attending job interviews
  going to court as a witness
  attending trade fairs for no longer than 7 days a month or 30 days in a calendar year
  attending board meetings
  meeting clients or customers (including entertainment like eating at a restaurant)
  meeting colleagues, contractors or sellers
  fact-finding visits
  negotiating deals or contracts
  attending conferences
  team building activities
  buying goods and services
  accompanying a tour as a tour guide, tour operator or travel agent
  leisure travel, such as holidays or visiting friends or family
Or for these types of training, as long as it’s for the same company or group:
  classroom-based training
  on-the-job training


Attending business meetings

You should only attend business meetings if there isn’t a colleague in Austria who can do this on your behalf. If you have to attend you:


  shouldn’t stay longer than a working week
  can’t charge the client for the meeting


These activities are covered by the Schengen visa waiver.

Border checks

At the border, you may be asked to show:


  proof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets
  health insurance that covers your entire stay
  proof of accommodation for your entire stay
  enough money for the duration of your trip
  an invitation letter that explains your trip


Check Austria’s exemptions

Certain types of work-related activities don’t require a visa or permit because they’re exempt.

All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.

You do not require a visa or permit if you’re a musician, performer or broadcaster and in Austria for up to 4 weeks.
This includes those involved in film, TV or radio, including the technical production team.

The organiser needs to notify the local public employment service no later than the first day of work in Austria.

EU intra-company transfer permits (EU ICT) from other countries

You don’t need a visa or permit if you have an EU intra-company transfer (EU ICT) from another country and you’re going to work for the Austrian branch for up to 90 days in a 180-day period.

Your employer has to notify the Zentrale Koordinationsstelle (ZKO) of the Federal Ministry of Finance before you travel.

Exemptions are covered by the visa waiver.

Show proof of exemption

You need to be able to show proof that you’re exempt to the authorities on request. This could be:


  an assignment letter
  employment confirmation
  a contract
  proof of required qualifications, such as a diploma or professional certificate, or proof of artistic activities


If you’re going for other work purposes for up to 4 months, you may need a short-term work permit.

If you’re going for longer than 4 months days you may need a long-term permit.

Further checks

If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from Austria’s embassy or immigration authorities.

Applying for a visa or permit

This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit to help you prepare, but you’ll need to check the exact rules and processes with Austria’s embassy or immigration authorities.

Taking your family

For the short-term visa and permits listed in this guide your family won’t be able to get dependant visas. They may be able to join you for up to 90 days under the visa waiver.

There may be different rules for taking families if you have a long-term permit.
