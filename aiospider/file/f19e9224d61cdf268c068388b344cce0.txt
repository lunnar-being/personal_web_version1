Today, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced the latest cohorts in its Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Program (LEEP). The 22 selected innovators will join an extensive network of mentors and experts at U.S. national laboratories to develop the next-generation technologies that will help pave the way to a clean-energy future.The program is a two-year fellowship that places some of the nation’s brightest scientists and engineers with national laboratories. During the fellowship, they will perform critical research and development that will ultimately bring their technologies from lab to market. The program also helps these innovators develop their entrepreneurial acumen, preparing them to launch successful energy and manufacturing businesses.“The Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Program helps promising scientists and engineers overcome what can often be their most difficult challenge in clean-energy innovation: moving their technologies out of the lab and into the marketplace,” said Acting Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Kelly Speakes-Backman. “We are eager to support these entrepreneurs through this mentorship program, which will help to bring new technologies to market, and accelerate the decarbonization of our economy, and launch new careers in clean energy.”This year’s selected innovators will focus on developing technologies to increase energy and material efficiency in U.S. manufacturing, which in turn will  The cohorts will participate in the following DOE programs: (AMO).
