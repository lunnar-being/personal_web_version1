          Details


          

    
            
This document lays out the details of the Pilot, our expectations for Pilot operators, and sets out how we will consider responses.

The Seasonal Workers Pilot will allow recruitment of a limited number of temporary migrants for specific seasonal roles in the horticultural sector. The Pilot will be managed by the Home Office under the T5 (Temporary Worker) Seasonal Worker immigration route.

If you want to apply to the operators of the temporary visa scheme, read the guide for how to recruit a poultry worker or HGV food driver with a temporary visa.

December 2020 update

The Seasonal Workers Pilot has been further expanded to allow farmers to hire up to 30,000 workers in 2021 – an increase from the previous 10,000 workers. The Pilot will operate with four scheme operators (Concordia, Pro-Force and two new operators).

February 2020 update

The Seasonal Workers Pilot was expanded to allow farmers to hire up to 10,000 workers in 2020 – an increase from the previous 2,500 workers. The Pilot operated in the same way as it did in 2019, with two scheme operators (Concordia and Pro-Force).

April 2019 update

Defra selected the two Pilot Operators who will be responsible for the process of recruiting workers:


  Concordia Ltd
  Pro-Force Ltd
