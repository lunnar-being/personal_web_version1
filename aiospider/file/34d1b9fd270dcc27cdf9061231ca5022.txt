          Details


          

    
            
This framework sets out Ofsted’s process for inspecting secure children’s homes.

Our approach is underpinned by the following 3 principles that apply to all social care inspections:


  to focus on the things that matter most to children’s lives
  to be consistent in our expectations of providers
  to prioritise our work where improvement is needed most

              In ‘The inspection report’ section, added clarification on the non-publication of child-friendly summary reports.
            
            
              2 July 2021
              Removed guidance on assurance visits, as we are no longer carrying these out.
            
            
              19 March 2021
              Added guidance on inspecting secure children’s homes during COVID-19 restrictions. Updated guidance to reflect the changes to Ofsted’s post-inspection processes and complaints handling (including the timeline) that we introduced in September 2020. Minor edits for readability.
