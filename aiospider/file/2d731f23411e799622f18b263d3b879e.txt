Award Number: DE-EE0009339CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): FLOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to University of Central Florida (UCF) to develop a cybersecurity framework for integration into operating distribution networks with high penetrations of solar photovoltaic (PV) resources and distributed energy resources (DER). Algorithms would be developed for incorporation into a software platform, which would enable network responses to potential cyberattacks. The project would be completed over three Budget Periods (BPs), with a Go/No-Go Decision Point in between each BP. This NEPA Review is applicable to all three BPs.
