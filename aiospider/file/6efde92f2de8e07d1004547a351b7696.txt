Almost all financial decision makers in the UK view the current economy as neutral or weak, but expectations for it in the next three months are slowly improving.

The majority feel banks are performing on par with expectations and would like them to increase the contactless payment limit. Half of consumers have decreased their usage of cash, while a quarter have increased their use of electronic payments.
