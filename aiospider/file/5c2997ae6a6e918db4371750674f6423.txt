Award Number: DE-EE0009363CX(s) Applied: A9Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): CTOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Yale University to research trends in the co-adoption of residential solar photovoltaic (PV) systems and associated technologies (e.g., energy storage technologies, electric vehicles, and energy efficiency technologies). Yale University and its project partners would analyze existing data on co-adoption across multiple states and would conduct consumer surveys to collect additional data on consumer behavior and perceptions relating to co-adoption of solar PV and energy storage technologies. The project would be completed over three Budget Periods (BPs), with a Go/No-Go Decision Point in between each BP. This NEPA review will be applicable to all three BPs.
