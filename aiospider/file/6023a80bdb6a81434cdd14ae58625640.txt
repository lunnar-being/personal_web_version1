          Details


          

    
            
This licence allows Natural England-registered volunteer bat roost visitors (VBRVs) to train unlicensed Natural England-registered VBRVs.

It also allows Natural England-registered VBRVs and trainee VBRVs accompanying them to:


  disturb bats
  take bats
  use artificial light like a torch
  use endoscopes
  use hand nets


This licence only allows you to carry out activities for Natural England’s Bat Advice Service.

This is a class licence – you do not need to apply for it but you must already:


  hold a level 1 survey class licence for VBRVs

  be registered as a Natural England volunteer
  have successfully completed a Natural England-provided ‘train the trainer’ course


Surveys must be for the conservation of bats.

Use a level 1 licence if you don’t need to train VBRVs.

Activities not covered

This licence does not cover you for any other volunteering activities or allow you to survey:


  for science, education or research
  for development
  hibernation sites
  for the national bat monitoring programme


Report action taken

You must return a report of action taken under a VBRV licence form (LR-CL15-16) no later than 30 June each year, even if you’ve taken no action.

If you fail to do this, you’re no longer registered to act under the licence.

This form is also used to renew your registration.
