Acquisition Letters (ALs) are issued under the authorities of the Senior Procurement Executives of DOE and NNSA. ALs are intended for use by procurement professionals of DOE and NNSA, primarily Contracting Officers, and other officials involved in the acquisition process. Only DOE and NNSA Contracting Officers make definitive interpretations of how ALs affect DOE and NNSA contracts and related procedures. ALs are effective upon issuance and until rescinded.The purpose of this AL is to provide policy guidance, and an implementing contract clause, governing data and computer software rights under those management and operating (M&O) contracts that include a technology transfer clause implementing the National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act (NCTTA) of 1989 (Pub, L. 101-189).
