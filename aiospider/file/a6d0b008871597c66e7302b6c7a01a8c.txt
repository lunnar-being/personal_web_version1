Sellafield Ltd are reliant on our supply chain to bring innovation into the organisation to help us solve some of our most complex and challenging problems.

Identifying ways in which we can deliver our mission safer, sooner and with added value is key to Sellafield Ltd’s success.

We need innovative ways of doing this and are reliant on our supply chain to help us solve some challenging problems.

Our procurement routes for innovation outlines a number of ways in which we may bring solutions into the business.

The definition of innovation has many interpretations. In this context we see innovation as ‘something that is new to Sellafield’.

We are a challenge led organisation and apply the rule of 80/20 around challenges out versus solutions in.

It is useful for suppliers to look at the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority’s Grand Challenges as many of Sellafield Ltd innovation needs will be focussed around these:


  reducing the waste
  intelligent infrastructure
  moving humans away from harm
  digital delivery


Our Future research and development report 2021 provides useful context regarding some of our challenges and successes.
