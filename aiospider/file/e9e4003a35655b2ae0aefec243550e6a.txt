Additions and Updates to the Gun Policy in America InitiativePhoto by Oleksandr/Adobe Stock
April 22, 2020

Since the March 2018 release of the first edition of The Science of Gun Policy report, there has been a surge in firearm-related scientific research. Through RAND’s Gun Policy in America initiative, and with funding from Arnold Ventures, we have incorporated this expanding body of research into our review of scientific evidence. Here, we describe the major updates and changes to the Gun Policy in America website, research reviews, and research tools since they were first presented in 2018.
Expanded and Updated Review of the Scientific Evidence on the Effects of Gun Policies 
In April 2020, we released the second edition of The Science of Gun Policy report and updated the Gun Policy in America website to reflect the revisions. In updating our synthesis of available research on gun policy, we incorporated findings from more recently published research and extended our search to include studies published since 1995. We also added five new classes of gun policies: prohibitions associated with domestic violence; extreme risk protection orders, or “red-flag” laws; firearm safety training requirements; bans on low-quality handguns, otherwise known as “Saturday night specials” or junk guns; and laws allowing armed staff in kindergarten through grade 12 (K–12) schools. Therefore, the second edition of our research review now synthesizes all evidence meeting our inclusion criteria for the effect of the following 18 classes of gun policies on eight outcomes:
Policies regulating who may legally own, purchase, or possess firearms

minimum age requirements 
prohibitions associated with mental illness
prohibitions associated with domestic violence
surrender of firearms by prohibited possessors
extreme risk protection orders 

Policies regulating firearm sales and transfers

background checks 
licensing and permitting requirements 
waiting periods
firearm safety training requirements 
lost or stolen firearm reporting requirements 
firearm sales reporting, recording, and registration requirements 
bans on the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines 
bans on low-quality handguns

Policies regulating the legal use, storage, or carrying of firearms

stand-your-ground laws
child-access prevention laws 
concealed-carry laws 
gun-free zones 
laws allowing armed staff in K–12 schools.

After reviewing thousands of candidate studies, we identified 123 that met our inclusion criteria, nearly double the number of included studies in our original review (63). Although they do not represent the full scope of firearm research that has been conducted over the past quarter of a century, the included studies provide some evidence that rigorous research on the effects of gun policies has been growing in recent years (see figure below).

Updated Conclusions

In our research synthesis, we analyze the available evidence for how each of the 18 policies affects eight outcomes (e.g., mass shootings) and provide our judgment of the strength of that evidence, using the following evidence ratings: inconclusive, limited, moderate, or supportive. (Read more about how these ratings are defined in What Science Tells Us About the Effects of Gun Policies.) 
For four of the policies we examined in our original review, the newly included literature increased the strength of available evidence above the rating of inconclusive or limited that we previously assigned it. Specifically, there is now supportive evidence, our strongest evidence rating, that stand-your-ground laws increase firearm homicides. In our first review, we found only limited or moderate evidence for the effects of stand-your-ground laws on firearm and total homicides, but four newer studies meeting our inclusion criteria all suggest that these laws elevate homicide rates. Because stand-your-ground laws are designed to empower victims of crime to defend themselves more effectively, it might be suggested that the rise in homicide rates is an intended effect of the laws, if the increases were driven by a surge in justifiable homicides. But that does not appear to be the case. For more on this topic, see What Science Tells Us About the Effects of Gun Policies.


Four newer studies meeting our inclusion criteria all suggest that stand-your-ground laws elevate homicide rates.
After reviewing more-recent work, we found moderate evidence that waiting periods reduce rates of firearm suicide and total homicide, and we found limited evidence that these policies reduce total suicide, firearm homicide, and violent crime rates. In our first review, we found no or only inconclusive evidence for the effects of waiting periods on suicide and violent crime outcomes. However, two studies meeting our inclusion criteria were since published, and we identified two earlier studies not included in our original review.


For two policy-outcome pairs, we revised our evidence ratings from inconclusive to limited. We found limited evidence that permit-to-purchase laws reduce firearm suicides among adults, and child-access prevention laws reduce assault injuries. These improvements in evidence ratings were based on our identification of additional studies that generally pointed in the same direction for these outcomes. Further research is needed to determine whether findings from the narrow pool of existing literature are sustained in studies that have better methodological rigor and identify effects using a larger set of state policy changes.


For three policies included in our initial review, our assessment of the methodological quality of included studies and incorporation of the new literature led us to downgrade our original evidence ratings.




Improving Gun Policy Research
Researchers review the challenges to the scientific study of gun policies and recommend ways to improve this body of research. »




In particular, we found inconclusive evidence for the effects of prohibitions associated with mental illness and background checks on total and firearm-related suicides. Originally, we concluded that the evidence for these areas was limited or moderate. Those conclusions were largely based on the findings of one study, which we have since determined failed to adequately account for serial correlation and thus likely overstated the precision of its estimated effects. In addition, a newly published study of high methodological quality that evaluated a longer time frame, and thus should have had greater power to detect effects, estimated only uncertain effects of background checks on total and firearm suicides. As a result, we revised our conclusions to suggest that current evidence for the effects of these policies on suicide outcomes is inconclusive.

We also revised our conclusions for the effects of these policies on violent crime outcomes. In our updated review, we found limited evidence that prohibitions associated with mental illness decrease violent crime, and we determined that evidence for the effects of that policy and background checks on total homicides is inconclusive. Originally, we found limited or moderate evidence for these effects. For the same reasons noted for suicide outcomes, our confidence in the evidence for these outcomes was reduced.

Finally, in the updated review, we found inconclusive evidence for the effects of concealed-carry laws on unintentional injuries and deaths. This revises our initial conclusion that there was limited evidence that concealed-carry laws increase unintentional injuries and deaths among adults, because we determined that both studies that contributed to that finding had serious methodological weaknesses.
Evidence for Newly Included Policies

Of the five new policies included in the updated review, we identified studies that met our inclusion criteria for four of them. For prohibitions associated with domestic violence, we concluded that there is moderate evidence that domestic violence restraining orders decrease total and firearm-related intimate partner homicides. Our conclusions were based on consistent findings of five studies, three of which did not have serious methodological weaknesses but used the same data source and covered largely overlapping time periods. Domestic violence represents one of the largest categories of gun violence in the United States. Almost half of all women who were murdered in the United States between 2003 and 2014 were killed by a man who was their current or former intimate partner, according to a 2017 study by Emiko Petrosky and colleagues. And of almost 4,000 women murdered in the United States in 2017, more than half were killed with firearms (based on data by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). In this context, it is noteworthy that there is now moderate evidence that state prohibitions on gun ownership for those subject to domestic violence restraining orders reduce total and firearm-related intimate partner homicides.


For extreme risk protection orders, firearm safety training requirements, and bans on low-quality handguns, the studies we identified that met our inclusion criteria resulted in inconclusive evidence. For laws allowing armed staff in K–12 schools, we identified no studies that met our inclusion criteria.
Updates to Gun Policy Research Essays
In addition to containing our analyses of the causal effects of 18 gun policies, the Gun Policy in America website includes many essays originally published in 2018 on such topics as trends in mass shootings, the use of taxation to reduce firearm violence or its consequences, whether the Australian gun buyback worked, and whether the availability of guns affects the prevalence of violence or suicide. In April 2020, we added an essay on policing interventions to reduce gun violence. This essay reviews current evidence for four types of policing interventions: place-based approaches, such as "hot spot" policing, the use of closed-circuit television, and gunshot detection technologies; problem-solving approaches, such as problem-oriented policing and homicide reviews; person-focused approaches, such as civil gang injunctions and focused deterrence; and community-based approaches, such as business improvement districts. The essays first published in 2018 are scheduled to be updated later in 2020.Estimates of State-Level Firearm Ownership Rates in the United States
Researchers need measures of state-level firearm ownership rates in order to understand how ownership rates may be affected by public policy and how they may affect crime rates or other key outcomes. Surprisingly, however, we do not have good information about how firearm ownership has fluctuated over time at the state level. In an effort to fill this gap, we developed state-level estimates of household firearm ownership from 1980 to 2016 using a small-area estimation technique and structural equation modeling. Researchers can use these measures to test theories about firearm ownership and use and their relationship to crime and public policy. (Read more in New Approaches to Understanding the Effects of Gun Policies.)
To make these estimates more accessible, we also created the Gun Ownership in America visualization, which displays how gun ownership rates in each state have changed over time and how current rates differ across the United States.State Firearm Law Navigator
Research on the effects of gun laws requires good data on when and where different types of laws have been implemented. To support this type of research, RAND maintains a longitudinal database of state firearm laws, which is available free to the public. This database was first released in 2018. It is revised regularly and was substantially expanded in 2019.
To make the law data more accessible, we created a State Firearm Law Navigator that allows users to examine specific laws that were in effect in a state in a given year between 1979 and 2019. Although the full database contains 17 classes of gun laws, the firearm law navigator currently displays just four: background check, child-access prevention, concealed-carry, and stand-your-ground laws. More laws will be added over time.References
