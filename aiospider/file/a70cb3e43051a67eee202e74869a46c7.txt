Only once since 2005 had the US recorded 340,000 new business applications in a month. Then came COVID-19. Since June 2020, every single month has at least matched that level. And the momentum is positive. The first five months of 2021 saw an average of 472,000 new business applications a month, many more than in the last five months of 2020 (410,000). New businesses with a high propensity to hire additional workers were even more numerous.
