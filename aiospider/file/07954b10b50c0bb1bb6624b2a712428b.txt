The Geospatial Commission and its Partner Bodies have produced the geospatial glossary to define the common terms used in the geospatial industry. The main purpose for the glossary is to help those new to geospatial data understand the terms used, as well as to provide anyone involved in the industry with a set of common definitions in one place.

If you have any feedback or comments about this glossary, please email us at geospatialcommission@cabinetoffice.gov.uk

Notes on Sources:


  Where possible, links are provided to websites from which the definitions were sourced or derived. Some definitions have been modified to suit the purpose of this glossary, for example, using less specialist or technical terms to suit a wider audience.
  In some cases, definitions have been derived from internal glossaries used by the Geo6 organisations, in which case a link to the organisation’s external website has been provided.
