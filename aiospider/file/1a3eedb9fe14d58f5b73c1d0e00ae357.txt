NSIP supports projects that may be high risk but have the potential for high returns and a clear target market.

Launched in 2020, NSIP ran two funding opportunities for project teams to advance their innovative products, services and technologies that have application in the space sector. In its pilot year (FY20/21), 27 grants were awarded to industry and academic-led project teams across the UK. In 21/22, NSIP provided additional grant funding to 11 of the pilot phase projects to enable these to continue advancing their innovative projects.


The latest call closed in September 2020.
