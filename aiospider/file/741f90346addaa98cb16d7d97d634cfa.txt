The National Security and Investment Act comes into force on 4 January 2022. The government will be able to scrutinise and intervene in acquisitions made by anyone, including businesses and investors, that could harm the UKâ€™s national security. The government will be able to impose certain conditions on an acquisition or in rare cases block it completely.

Under the National Security and Investment Act, there are new rules that apply to certain acquisitions of entities or assets that are outside, but have a connection to, the UK.

This guidance tells you:


  what type of acquisitions outside of the UK are covered by the new rules
  common circumstances that would put an acquisition in scope of the new rules
  examples of how the rules may affect parties not based in the UK


You should read this alongside guidance on how to prepare for the National and Security Investment Act.
