 — The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today announced eight university-led projects will receive nearly $6.2 million in federal funding for research and development projects aimed at advancing hydrogen—a clean burning fuel—as a high-performing, efficient gas for turbine-based electricity generation. Increasing the reliability, efficiency, and performance of hydrogen power will reduce carbon emissions and advance the Biden-Harris administration's goal of a 100% clean electricity by 2035. “Our economic competitors are getting serious about harnessing carbon emissions free power from hydrogen, and so the U.S. must as well,” said . “Congress has entrusted DOE as the nation’s leading funder of the physical sciences, and we’re proud to invest in the brilliant scientific minds in our nation’s university system that are helping us ensure every American can access reliable, zero-carbon power.”  The eight projects supported by the DOE Office of Fossil Energy’s “University Turbines Systems Research (USTR)” program will study fundamental scientific challenges and applied engineering issues associated with advancing the performance and efficiency of combustion turbines fueled with pure hydrogen, hydrogen and natural gas mixtures, and other carbon-free hydrogen containing fuels.  Each project is led by a faculty member or principal investigator with robust engagement from graduate students. The universities receiving awards include: The UTSR Program conducts cutting-edge research with the nation’s universities to increase the efficiency and performance of gas turbines while also reducing emissions. With renewed interest in the use of hydrogen, a clean-burning fuel, for turbine-based electricity generation, these projects will advance hydrogen as a gas turbine fuel to help achieve the decarbonization priorities of the Biden Administration, including enabling economy-wide net-zero emissions by 2050, while ensuring affordable, reliable energy supplies for U.S. economic growth. ###
