The UK and Mexico are committed partners in tackling climate change to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and encourage inclusive economic growth.

Our shared ambition is reflected in the UK-Mexico Partnership for Sustainable and Inclusive Growth. Under the Partnership, which was signed in 2019, both countries agreed to increase political collaboration and investment to tackle climate change and reduce poverty.
