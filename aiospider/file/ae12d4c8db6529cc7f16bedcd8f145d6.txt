Award Number: DE-EE0009288CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Bioenergy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): CAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Opus 12 Inc. to develop a novel single-cell electrolyzer to convert carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide. Opus 12 would build on past efforts and further develop components of the device, including scaling up integrated membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) to have a larger active area (>750 cm2). Pilot electrolyzer cells would be fabricated and tested for performance efficiency.
