The INSULATE Program seeks to support the development of technologies to advance the performance of transformer insulation and/or cooling components in order to increase the service life, reliability, efficiency, and survivability of Large Power Transformers (LPT) used on the powergrid. In particular, INSULATE technologies aim to increase the life expectancy of LPTs by exploring solutions in (1) high-performance solid insulation materials; (2) advanced insulating fluids with improved dielectric strength, thermal conductivity, and ageing performance; and (3) kraft paper rejuvenating additives.
