Award Number: DE-EE0009017CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): WAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to BlueDot Photonics to develop a novel deposition method for thin film solar photovoltaic (PV) applications using perovskite materials. Deposition would involve the use of a vapor-based continuous flash sublimation (CFS) process which would be developed so as to be compatible with existing manufacturing methods. As part of the project, BlueDot Photonics would fabricate prototype versions of a device which would be used for thin film deposition. The prototypes would be tested and optimized over the course of the project. The project would be divided into two Budget Periods (BPs), with a Go/No-Go Decision Point in between each BP.
