This handbook is primarily a guide for Ofsted inspectors on how to carry out inspections of maintained schools and academies under section 5 of the Education Act 2005.

We also publish this for schools and other interested parties so that they are aware of Ofsted’s inspection processes and procedures under the education inspection framework (EIF).

We have also published guidance for section 8 school inspections, along with Inspecting schools: guide for maintained and academy schools.
