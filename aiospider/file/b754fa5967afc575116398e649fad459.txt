The project goal is to develop a scalable modular home design and construction process that can produce homes with 50% energy savings and no incremental cost versus site-built single-family homes built to the IECC 2018 energy code. Objectives of the project include:The project team will implement enhanced factory automation and robotics into their modular home production facility. The TEAMH project will expand the current automation plans to deliver a process that includes the following key elements:For the research project, the project team will demonstrate production for Cold/Very Cold climates with a demonstration in a Climate Zone 5 site such as Lake Tahoe, California.TEAMH showcases residential construction practices that overcome industry challenges such as higher consumer expectations, skilled labor shortages, more rigorous energy codes, and new technologies.
