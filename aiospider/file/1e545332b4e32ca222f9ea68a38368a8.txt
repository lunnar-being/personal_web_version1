              The notice has been updated to clarify the Making Tax Digital rules at section 2.1, and at section 3.2.1.1 to reflect that for a small number of businesses the Making Tax Digital rules will not apply until their first VAT Return period starting on or after 1 October 2019 and that the digital links ‘soft landing period’ for those deferred businesses will be 12 months from their start date.
