The supplier assurance questionnaire  (SAQ) forms part of the Defence Cyber Protection Partnership (DCPP) Cyber Security Model.

The contracting authority will first perform a risk assessment (RA) of the contract’s Cyber Risk Profile. Suppliers can then complete an SAQ to demonstrate their compliance with this Cyber Risk Profile.
