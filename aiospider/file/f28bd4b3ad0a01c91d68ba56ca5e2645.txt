Award Number: DE-EE0009356CX(s) Applied: A9Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): MAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to Northeastern University (NEU) to develop machine learning measurement software for solar photovoltaic (PV) distribution system applications. The software would interpret raw data from PV systems to provide state estimates and real-time model feedback. Existing PV system data would be used for algorithm development and modeling. The project would be completed over three Budget Periods (BPs), with a Go/No-Go Decision Point in between each BP.
