          Details


          

    
            
This licence allows Natural England-registered volunteer bat roost visitors (VBRVs) and Natural England-registered trainee VBRVs accompanying them to:


  disturb bats
  take bats
  use artificial light like a torch
  use endoscopes
  use hand nets
  use static hand-held nets


This licence only allows you to carry out activities for Natural England’s Bat Advice Service.

You need a level 2 licence to train VBRVs.

Surveys must be for the conservation of bats.

Activities not covered

This licence does not cover you for any other volunteering activities and does not allow you to survey:


  for science, education or research
  for development
  hibernation sites
  for the national bat monitoring programme


Register with Natural England

This is a class licence – you do not need to apply for it but you must register with Natural England as follows.


  Use the VBRV expression of interest form - you must do this first.
  Use the disturb or take bats application form (Class-A34).


Report action taken

You must return a report of action taken under a VBRV class licence (LR-CL15-16) no later than 30 June each year, even if you’ve taken no action.

If you fail to do this, you’re no longer registered to act under the licence and cannot carry out roost visits for Natural England’s Bat Advice Service.

This form is also used to renew your registration.
