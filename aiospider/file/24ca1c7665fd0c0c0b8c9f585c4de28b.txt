Award Number: DE-EE0008997CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): OHOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Echogen Power Systems (Echogen) to develop and test a novel gas compressor design for electro-thermal energy storage system operation in concentrated solar power applications. Echogen would seek to improve the performance operation of the compressor as compared to current technologies, by optimizing component efficiency. The project would be completed over three Budget Periods (BPs), with a Go/No-Go Decision Point in between each BP.
