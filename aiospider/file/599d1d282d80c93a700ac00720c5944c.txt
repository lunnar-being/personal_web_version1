Award Number: DE-EE0008847CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Fuel Cell Technologies OfficeLocation(s): CTOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to FuelCell Energy, Inc. for the development of a Reversible Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (RSOFC) system for use in electric energy storage. Design and testing of laboratory scale RSOFC stacks would occur at Versa Power Systemâ€™s test facilities in Calgary, AB in Canada. FuelCell Energy would design, build, and test a prototype RSOFC system at their facility in Danbury, CT. Additionally, project work would include concept system design and techno-economic studies of commercial systems based on the results of the laboratory-scale tests.
