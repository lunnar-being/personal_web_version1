In 2019, most plug-in electric vehicles were powered by lithium-ion batteries. The cells in a lithium-ion battery are more complex than the lead-acid cells of a conventional vehicle’s battery, and they are composed of different materials. The exact chemistry of automotive lithium-ion batteries can vary by manufacturer. The Department of Energy has recently launched the  to further research on recycling technologies for current lithium-ion batteries and future battery chemistries.
