Award Number: DE-EE0009032CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.1, B3.6Geothermal Technologies OfficeLocation(s): WIOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to University of Wisconsin (UW) to develop a protocol for simulating the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of stress in geothermal systems. UW and its project partners would develop a multi-physics modeling technology that would interpret data from hydrological,Â thermal, and mechanical processes over varied spatial and temporal scales. Once developed, the modeling technology could be used to optimize the placement of injection and production wells. Data for the model would be obtained, in part, from the San Emidio geothermal site, operated by Ormat Technologies, in Nevada. The project would be completed over three Budget Periods (BPs), with a Go/No Go Decision Point in between each BP.
