Those in need of support should contact their local council to find out more information and help them access the fund.


On 30 September 2021, the government announced that vulnerable households across the country will be able to access a new £500 million support fund to help them with essentials over the winter. This funding covers the period 6 October 2021 to 31 March 2022 inclusive.

The new Household Support Fund will be distributed by councils in England to directly help those who need it most. The grant will be distributed through small payments to support vulnerable households meet daily needs such as food, clothing, and utilities.

As the Barnett formula will apply in the usual way to additional funding in England, the devolved administrations will receive up to £79 million of the £500 million. This will be £41 million for the Scottish Government, £25 million for the Welsh Government and £14 million for the Northern Ireland Executive. It will be for the devolved administrations to decide how to allocate this additional funding.
