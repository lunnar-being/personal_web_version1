Award Number: DE-EE0008628CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Water Power Technologies OfficeLocation(s): MAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Littoral Power Systems Inc. (LPS) to develop a novel turbine system for energy generation in slow-moving water currents. The project would seek to mature the design of major system components within the turbine system. As part of the project, a laboratory scale test article (LSTA) would be fabricated and tested in laboratory settings to validate the systemâ€™s performance capabilities. The LSTA would serve as a proof of concept, before fabricating a proportional prototype for in-water testing.
