This paper explains the methodology used to determine the administrative strike prices (ASPs) for the Contracts for Difference (CfD) Allocation Round 4 (AR4), which is open to pot 1 (established technologies), pot 2 (less established) technologies and pot 3 (offshore wind projects).

The auction will be held on a pay-as-clear basis, subject to no project receiving a higher strike price than its technology-specific ASP. The ASPs therefore act as a cap on the level of support available to each technology.
