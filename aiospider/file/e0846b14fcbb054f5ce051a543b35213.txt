Portuguese consumers continue to feel the economic effects of the crisis, and their concerns about health, safety, and the economy are increasing. Most consumers still believe that the personal and financial impact of COVID-19 will continue to last well beyond two months. They expect to cut their spending across almost all categories. However, the proportion of consumers’ income, spending, and savings affected by the COVID-19 situation has decreased slightly since the last pulse. Portuguese consumers have been leaving home mainly to shop and meet family, and expect to continue doing so in the near future. In addition to lifted restrictions, consumers are waiting for the endorsement of medical authorities prior to engaging in out-of-home activities.These exhibits are based on survey data collected in Portugal from June 19–21, 2020. Check back for regular updates on Portuguese consumer sentiments, behaviors, income, spending, and expectations.
