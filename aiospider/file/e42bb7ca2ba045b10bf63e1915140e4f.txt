The meeting was intended to explore bridging the resettlement, academic, and technology communities within the United States to facilitate the integration of Afghan partners and allies into U.S. society.
The forum began with opening remarks from OSTP Director Eric Lander and was followed by a briefing on Operation Allies Welcome from Department of Homeland Security officials, as well as the State Department’s partnership efforts on long-term social and economic integration of vulnerable/at-risk Afghans into American communities. Director Lander spoke on the need to develop bridges between the resettlement community, colleges, universities, and other professional organizations to improve resettlement outcomes, providing opportunities for scholars and other professionals to best utilize their substantial skills and talents in their new home.
Approximately 75 representatives from government, university, and scientific associations attended the event to explore options for Afghan scholars and professionals. OSTP will continue to engage with scientific and technology communities to help ensure the best outcomes for Afghan partners and allies as they are welcomed to their new homes throughout the United States.
