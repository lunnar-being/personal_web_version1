Award Number: DE-EE0009083CX(s) Applied: A9, B5.1Building Technologies OfficeLocation(s): WIOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to Slipstream Group, Inc. (Slipstream) to analyze and field test the grid-interactive flexible building loads potential for two integrated systems: 1) connected lighting, automated shades, and intelligent energy storage; and 2) connected lighting and automated shades. Project work would be completed over two Budget Periods (BPs). BP1 activities include product investigation and conceptual integration design, field test site identification, customer engagement, and preliminary individual system design (for the retrofit of two field test sites), as well as preliminary technical analysis of the flexible building loads potential. BP2 would include the completion of field testing, building energy model validation and technical analysis,Â and the final reporting.
