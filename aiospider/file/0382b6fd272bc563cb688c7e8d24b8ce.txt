At McKinsey’s COP26 session Thursday on urban sustainability and resilience, partner Brodie Boland led a conversation with experts on how stakeholders can accelerate action on creating more sustainable, resilient cities. It’s a challenge with wide implications: Cities are home to more than half of the world’s people—“they’re what bring us together,” as McKinsey senior partner Jonathan Woetzel said—and our analysis shows that by 2050, that figure is projected to rise to 68 percent. At the same time, urban areas are often located in places particularly prone to climate risk, such as on coastlines, floodplains, and islands. Cities also contribute to 70 percent of the world’s carbon emissions. “If we do not get a handle on what we’re doing in cities, we will not be able to address the underlying driver of the growth in our emissions over time,” Jonathan said. “We have to address how we can decouple emissions from growth, and the other challenge is resilience—which is to say that, there’s no way we’re getting out of this unscathed.”Excerpts from the entire discussion, edited for clarity, are below.

This includes flooding from monsoonal rains, which account for about 90 percent of annual rainfall, tidal floods and storm surge from typhoons, and other weather events. In our scenario-planning models, we quantify the possible impact on the city as floods hit real estate and infrastructure assets.Learn more about urban sustainability and resilience with these McKinsey articles:
