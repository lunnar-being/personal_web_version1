Award Number: DE-EE0009028CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): FLOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to the University of Central Florida (UCF) to develop a unified control design framework for grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) inverters. The proposed research would address the fundamental GFM/GFL inverter control problems for power grids with high inverter-based energy resources (IERs) penetration by designing and testing a unified control design to simplify control implementation, advance standardization of control and communication for IERs, and speed up the integration of IERs.
