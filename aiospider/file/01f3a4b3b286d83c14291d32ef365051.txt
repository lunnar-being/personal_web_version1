The Department for Education (DfE) is publishing a voluntary code of safeguarding practice for out-of-school settings (OOSS).

The non-statutory code of practice is intended to support providers of OOSS. It covers advice on what policies and procedures providers should have in place for health and safety, safeguarding and child protection, staff suitability, and governance.

The guidance for parents and carers is intended to help parents choose a safer setting for their child.

The guidance covers:


  community activities
  after-school clubs
  supplementary schools
  tuition
  music lessons
  sports training
  
    other activities for children that take place without their parents’ or carers’ supervision, that are not a:

    
      school
      college
      16 to 19 college
      provider caring for children under 8 years old registered with Ofsted or a childminder agency
    
  


We held a out-of-school settings: voluntary safeguarding code of practice consultation, and the code and other materials have been developed in collaboration with the sector and other stakeholders such as Ofsted and the Charity Commission.
