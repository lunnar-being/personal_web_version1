  An overview of the Water Resource Management grant – who can apply, what the grants will fund and
how much funding is available 

      
        
          

    Who can apply

Only arable and horticultural businesses growing, or intending to grow, irrigated food crops, ornamentals or forestry nurseries in England can apply for the water management grants.

The land on which these activities take place must be owned by you, or you must have a tenancy agreement in place until 5 years after the project has been completed.

Who cannot apply

The following are not eligible for the grants.


  Public organisations, including Crown bodies and non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs)
  Local authorities
  Members of Producer Organisations under the Fresh Fruit and Vegetables Aid Scheme if they have funding for the same project through their operational programme


How much money you can apply for

For each project, the minimum grant you can apply for is £35,000. The maximum grant is £500,000.
Grants can cover up to 40% of the eligible costs of a project. The minimum total eligible cost of a project would therefore be £87,500.

At least 60% of the project costs must be paid for with money from private sources like savings or a bank loan.

You must be able to pay the remaining project costs.  You can use loans, overdrafts and certain other grants, such as the Basic Payment Scheme or agri-environment schemes such as the Countryside Stewardship scheme.

You cannot use other public money (for example grant funding from local authorities) towards the project costs. You cannot use this grant to carry out capital works which are required under other agreements.

Paying for the project

Grants are paid in arrears. They can only be claimed after the work being claimed for is finished and has been paid for. We expect you to make a maximum of 3 claims over the course of the project.

Hire-purchase or leased items must be paid off before you claim.

If you buy an item for the project using lease purchase or hire purchase, you must own this outright before you can claim any grant money towards it.

This means that, before you claim the grant, you must:


  pay all of the instalments
  show that the title has passed to you


Otherwise, you will not be able to include these costs in your claim.

Do not start work, incur costs (including paying deposits), enter into any legal contracts, or place an order before the project start date in your Grant Funding Agreement. Any expenditure incurred before that date is at your own risk and may make your whole project ineligible.
