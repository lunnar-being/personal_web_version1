Award Number: DE-EE0009085CX(s) Applied: A9Building Technologies OfficeLocation(s): NYOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) to develop an internet-based interactive career map that would provide users with information associated with energy efficiency jobs. The career map tool would identify potential opportunities, chart potential advancement routes between occupations, and identify training, skills, and credentials necessary to apply for the positions. IREC would engage with industry stakeholders to identify career opportunities and inform development of the career map tool. IREC would then engage with low-income communities and other vulnerable populations to relay information about the career map. The project would be completed over two Budget Periods (BPs), with a Go/No-Go Decision Point in between each BP.
