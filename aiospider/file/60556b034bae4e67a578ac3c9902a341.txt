Teacher assessment frameworks for the 2018/19 academic year onwards

Teachers must use these frameworks for the 2021/22 academic year onwards to make teacher assessment judgements for pupils at the end of key stage 1 in English reading, English writing, mathematics and science.

These frameworks were updated in 2018 for use from the 2018/19 academic year onwards.

The English writing frameworks remain unchanged from those introduced for 2017/18.


Comparability over time

Judgements made against the 2018/19 onwards teacher assessment frameworks will not be directly comparable to those made against previous versions, with the exception of English writing, which used the same frameworks for 2017/18.
