Environmental permits have conditions that require operators to control pollution – this includes controlling noise and vibration.

The Environment Agency, Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Natural Resources Wales and Northern Ireland Environment Agency have produced this guidance to help holders and potential holders of permits apply for, vary, and comply with their permits.

This guidance covers:


  how the environment agencies will assess noise from certain industrial processes
  what the law says you must do to manage noise and vibration
  advice on how to manage noise – in particular, how to carry out a noise impact assessment and what operators should include in a noise management plan
