Award Number: DE-EE0009076CX(s) Applied: A9Building Technologies OfficeLocation(s): MDOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Newport Partners to develop and test a novel residential hybrid heat pump (HHP) system and optimized control (OC) platform. The HHP system and OC platform would be designed to be more energy efficient than comparable fossil-fuel fired furnaces. Both hardware and software would be developed as part of the project. Performance testing of the HHP system and OC platform would then be performed at an existing, occupied residential location.
