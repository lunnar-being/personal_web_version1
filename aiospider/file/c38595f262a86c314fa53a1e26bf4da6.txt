That network will connect platforms at sea, air and land with space sensors, thereby enabling the warfighters.Another endeavor, he said, is using laser communications between satellites for greater speed and efficiency.Chai said the MDA is working closely with the SDA as well as the Space Force.




The MDA is working hard to not only build a more effective and resilient space-based system, but also to build it more cost effectively, he said.Â Regarding MDA's HBTSS program, he said that competitors, China and Russia, are advancing hypersonic weapons that can evade terrestrial-based radar by flying low and are highly maneuverable. That's why space-based sensors are so important.The challenge for the MDA is tracking hypersonics or ballistic missiles using their heat signatures. However, that heat signature may be hard to track against the background of the climate. The other challenge is tracking a large number of incoming missiles simultaneously.Both directors discussed their plans to launch and test hundreds of satellites that will form a mesh network in space beginning this year and continuing in the coming years. The space architecture should be operational by next year.
