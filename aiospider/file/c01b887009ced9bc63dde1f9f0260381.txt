UKHSA publishes weekly statistics on coronavirus (COVID-19) contact tracing dating from when the NHS Test and Trace service started on 28 May 2020.

These statistics cover:


  number of people tested for coronavirus in England
  number of people who tested positive for coronavirus in England
  time taken for test results to become available in England
  distance to take a test in-person in England
  number of people testing positive for coronavirus in England that were then transferred to the contact-tracing system, and the time taken for them to be reached
  number of recent close contacts identified, and the time taken for them to be reached
  number of people starting their quarantine at home or in a managed quarantine hotel
  number of LFD and pillar 2 tests conducted in England


This document sets out information on the data sources and methodology that are used to generate each of these  measures. It will keep being updated with further detail.
