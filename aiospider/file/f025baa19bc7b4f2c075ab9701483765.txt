Teacher assessment frameworks for the 2018/19 academic year onwards

Teachers must use these frameworks for the 2018/19 academic year onwards to make statutory teacher assessment judgements for pupils at the end of key stage 2 in English writing and science.

The English writing frameworks remain unchanged from those introduced for 2017/18.

The frameworks do not include English reading and mathematics because schools are not required to make statutory teacher assessment judgements in these subjects.


Comparability over time

Changes made to the 2018/19 science key stage 2 teacher assessment frameworks mean that judgements made using this guidance will not be directly comparable to those made using the previous versions.
