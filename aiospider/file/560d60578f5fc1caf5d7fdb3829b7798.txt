Award Number: DE-EE0008923CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Bioenergy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): COOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Colorado State University (CSU) to develop a process to convert wet waste (e.g. food waste and cattle manure) into biofuels. The process would incorporate anaerobic digestion (AD) to convert the initial inputs into volatile fatty acids (VFAs), chemical extraction/electrodialysis to separate the VFAs, and bioelectrosynthesis to upgrade the VFAs to alcohols.
