Pulling back the curtain on our work as technology lawyers at McKinsey, by describing what it means to be a lawyer in emerging tech; how we work to stay in sync with the pace of innovation; what we do to promote knowledge-sharing, legal insights and continuous up-skilling; and how we design-think and ruthlessly collaborate to bring innovation forward, and counsel our internal clients with creativity and impact.We’re privileged to live in a time where technology moves at the speed of sound and new use cases rapidly emerge across industries. The law, by its precedential nature, tends to trail the development of technology and deconstructs and derisks a path already charted by technology, rather than leading with prescriptive considerations.As technology lawyers at McKinsey, our work is focused on looking around the corner: identifying a broader regulatory context, intuiting vectors of guidance, and shaping an early perspective around approaches to mitigate emerging risks. In the words of Spiderman, “With great strength comes great responsibility.” In working with highly complex, nuanced technologies that can do a substantial amount of good, there are also embedded risks that should be managed for effective and ethical performance.Recent discussions around AI tend to prize the “human-centered” approach—the benefit of putting the interests of people first—and this principle aptly describes the lawyering style we’ve instituted across our tech legal team. To stay sharp on “technology law” and its orbit, we’re constantly learning, sharing, and upskilling ourselves on the current and future state and consistently iterating new ways to move the needle to sharpen our expertise and practice innovation. The year 2020 was unpredictable and challenging, but also a year that offered an opportunity to embrace change, practice agility, and lean into a shared space of openness. We saw each other’s homes, babies, and wall-mounted hobbies, and through this strange new way of working, we opted for cross-departmental intellectual openness, too—a method rooted in learning, collaboration, and building on the greatest asset we have: our individual and collective expertise.Some of what our tech legal team introduced over the past 18 months spans:At the root of it all, we’ve operated and continue to operate on the core principle that leaning into the pace of innovation in our discipline means applying ingenuity in the way we practice. The work we do to craft, shape, and reframe our methodologies and approaches to practicing law and counseling our internal clients aims to both sharpen our expertise and deepen those client relationships. After all, being a thought partner and strategic advisor to our teams means intellectually investing in the space that we’re working in, intuiting its dynamic depth and breadth, and anticipating unchartered considerations.Create; design think; cross-collaborate; knowledge share; stay human-centric, upskill; reframe; design sprint; and think around the corner. We do our best work when we establish, revisit, and iterate on first principles while ideating new vectors of tactical innovation in our field—because sometimes you need to fine tune the brakes to move faster, as the pointed lesson goes.
