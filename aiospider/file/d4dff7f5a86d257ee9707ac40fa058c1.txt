In a national survey of around 1,000 employers, we explore the most concerning factors for employee health and employer plans to respond. Behavioral health is among the top workforce health concerns with 9 out of 10 employers surveyed noting that COVID-19 is affecting their workforce behavioral health and/or productivity. We also explore variations in responses across different types of employers along with potential actions for healthcare payers and/or employers to consider to address the behavior.
