To meet point 5 of the Technology Code of Practice (TCoP) and the government’s cloud first policy, your plans must show you’ve considered using cloud computing before other options.

If you’re going through the spend control process you must explain how you’re trying to meet point 5.


The Central Digital and Data Office is currently collecting feedback on the Technology Code of Practice. The aim is to improve the content and make sure it meets user needs. If you want to add your feedback, please complete this short survey.


Cloud computing

Cloud computing is a way of storing and retrieving data and software over the internet without buying your own hardware. The 3 main types of cloud computing service you can use are:


  software-as-a-service (SaaS), which provides applications over the internet
  platform-as-a-service (PaaS), which provides platforms for developing, testing and deploying your applications over the internet
  infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), which provides the virtual infrastructure or network you need to host services over the internet


How using the cloud will help you

You can use cloud computing to treat compute, network, storage and power as utilities. This means you can:


  spend more time building the services that are important to your users and less time running data centres
  avoid upfront investments on your infrastructure
  reduce your overall costs by making use of the scalable pricing model
  have greater flexibility to trial new services or make changes, with lower cost and effort
  meet the Greening Government strategy, and reduce your environmental impact by using cloud facilities with more efficient use of power and server space
  have greater security as the provider will make regular technology upgrades and apply security patches
  have better service availability for all users
  increase access to skilled resources to support your staff
  allow for better continuous improvement planning


Choosing the cloud computing services for your organisation

When you procure or renew services, all government organisations must consider and fully evaluate potential cloud solutions first before you consider any other option.

You can read guidance on migrating to and using cloud in the public sector, to help you choose and use cloud computing services.

You can also use GOV.UK Platform as a Service to provide underlying infrastructure and host services in the cloud.

To choose the right cloud computing service for your organisation you’ll need to:


  make sure it fits with your cloud hosting strategy

  consider your legacy technology

  assess a hosting business case



Migrating to the cloud

When choosing how and what to migrate to the cloud, you should:


  be aware of government policy and guidance on offshoring and data residency

  make sure your chosen cloud solution has the appropriate level of security

  where possible, choose a multidisciplinary team of commercial, technical and service delivery
  consider the amount of vendor lock-in and how to manage technical lock-in in the cloud you’re willing to accept
  make sure your staff have suitable training to implement and use cloud computing
