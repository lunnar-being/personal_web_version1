If implemented effectively, with sufficient consideration given as to their application in the context of the fisheries enforcement issues the Overseas Territories seek to address, then new technologies could represent a real ‘game-changer’.

On 16 January 2019, the MMO brought together Overseas Territory representatives with technology leaders from across academia, industry, NGOs, and government agencies, to discuss how we take these exciting new technologies forward in an effective and efficient way.
