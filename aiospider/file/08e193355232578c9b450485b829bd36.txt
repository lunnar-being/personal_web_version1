The purpose of this guidance is to help businesses understand and comply with their existing obligations under consumer protection law when making environmental claims.

This guidance sets out principles which are designed to help businesses comply with the law. It explains each of these principles. It gives examples of how each of them applies and more detailed case studies where multiple principles apply. The guidance also sets out the legal framework on which these principles are based.

The guidance is not an exhaustive guide to making environmental claims. It covers areas the CMA considers most likely to be relevant and more likely to be of concern to enforcement authorities, but does not cover every situation in which an infringement may occur.

While the guidance is designed to help businesses, it is not legal advice. Responsibility for complying with the law remains with businesses themselves.
