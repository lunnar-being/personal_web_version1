The Programme and Project Partners model is changing the way we deliver projects at Sellafield and creating a lasting legacy through long-term partnerships.

To support this legacy, The Programme and Project Partners social impact team have launched a supply chain toolkit aimed at supporting businesses and small to medium-sized enterprises to help them understand social impact.

The new toolkit will help supply chain partners to understand what social impact is, why it is important and how to embed it into a procurement process and support positive changes in the community.
