Introduction to the SCS capability framework

The Analysis Function Senior Civil Service (SCS) Capability Framework has been developed through consultation with a range of professions and senior analysts from across government.

The frameworks present an opportunity for individuals in SCS roles, or individual considering working at SCS level in the future, to consider their own capabilities, the capabilities required by analytical SCS and those capabilities they might wish to develop further.  The frameworks can also form part of talent conversations and provide assistance when developing role profiles for recruitment campaigns.  The frameworks follow the below core principles:


  The Framework comprises common capabilities across the Analysis Function articulating the skills and capabilities required by senior analysts when leading multidisciplinary teams.
  Indicators are relevant to all professions that comprise the function equally and are not weighted to any profession.
  Some roles may have cross-department / government engagement as a requirement of part or the whole of their role, this needs to be taken into consideration when comparing them to another whose role is entirely Directorate focused.
  There are three levels of capability based on the scale and complexity of impact with each level building on the previous level
  There is an expectation that those working at Levels 2 and 3 will demonstrate the capabilities at Level 1 or levels below as well as those at the level they are being assessed at.


Analysis Function SCS 1 Capability Framework




  Level 1: Strategically operates at a level that demonstrates impact, and embeds approaches and policies across the directorate/division level within the department.
  Level 2: Strategically operates at a level that demonstrates impact, and embeds approaches and policies across group, department or organisation dependent on size of the department/organisation and structure.
  Level 3: Strategically operates at a level that demonstrates impact, and embeds approaches and policies across department or organisation and wider Civil Service or Public Sector.
