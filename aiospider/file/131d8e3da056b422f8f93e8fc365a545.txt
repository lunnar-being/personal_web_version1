The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has its roots in the years just after the Second World War, when the government sought a new purpose for the sprawling laboratory system it had built for the Manhattan Project. At the time, these labs employed the finest scientific talent in the world. That distinction remains true today, though the mission has grown far beyond atomic energy and defense.Now part of DOE, our 17 National Laboratories and supporting facilities make up one of the largest science research enterprises in the world. Far from being limited to energy, the National Labs unlock discoveries across the full spectrum of science, including particle physics, chemistry, materials science, genomics, and medicine. Many of these discoveries contribute to the development of new commercial products that improve American lives and energize our economy.Part of the job at DOE’s Office of Technology Transitions is to collect and publicize the incredible work produced by our Labs every day. The latest OTT report, , shines a light on DOE-powered innovations that have propelled and continue to drive real progress in the medical field, helping to save patients’ lives and enhance our understanding of the human body.“In its over 75 years of existence, our National Laboratory system has made an impact across a vast and multidisciplinary R&D portfolio, including critical advances in the medical sciences. These breakthroughs energize our economy, improve human health and hone our technological edge on the global stage, delivering a triple-bottom-line return on taxpayers’ investment in our research."From better imaging and detection of breast cancer to improved stent materials and high-volume protein production, the National Labs and their industrial and academia partners have made groundbreaking discoveries to feed the innovation pipeline of America’s private sector—enabling novel tools and technologies that maintain the nation’s technology leadership and improve America’s health care capabilities.For the complete story, please download our latest report below—and thanks to our Labs for continuing to redefine the possible and turn research into reality.
