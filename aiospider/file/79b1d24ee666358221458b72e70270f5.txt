Investments in research and development (R&D) made by the federal government play a critical supporting role in America’s economic growth. The U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) invests in a broad range of cost-shared R&D projects in transportation, energy efficiency, and renewable power to address challenges and gaps in technology development. These federal investments aim to promote new technological advances, as well as stimulate and enable the private sector to accelerate the transfer of research discoveries into commercial technologies.
