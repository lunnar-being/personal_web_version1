Award Number: DE-EE0009080CX(s) Applied: A9, A11Building Technologies OfficeLocation(s): COOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to the International Center for Appropriate and Sustainable Technology (ICAST) to build support for and interest in very high efficiency (VHE) technologies. This project would focus on the multifamily housing market through activities designed to educate owners, legislators, and government agency representatives about the costs and benefits of VHE heat pump heating ventilation and cooling and domestic hot water systems. This DOE project is fundamentally about ICAST providing education to and engaging key stakeholders in recruiting owner participation in pilot projects and then analyzing data and developing case studies from those projects. While DOE does expect installations of VHE technologies in multifamily housing to stem from project activities, no project funding is going toward the installation of these technologies and the DOE has no control or discretion over which technologies may be selected for installation or which multifamily home owner may choose to install those technologies. As such, DOEâ€™s NEPA review is limited to the scope of the DOE funded project which involves focusing on gathering data and research; plan development; education, outreach, consulting, and advocacy; walk-thru energy audits; and data analysis and sharing.
