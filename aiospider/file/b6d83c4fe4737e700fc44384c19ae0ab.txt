 – The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today announced over $33 million in funding for 82 projects supported by the Office of Technology Transitions (OTT) Technology Commercialization Fund (TCF). With over $36 million in matching funds from the private sector, these projects will advance the commercialization of promising energy technologies and strengthen partnerships between DOE’s National Laboratories and private sector companies to deploy these technologies to the marketplace.“In order to maintain America’s technological leadership on the global stage, the Trump Administration has tapped an unprecedented response from government, academia, and our mission-critical, private-sector innovators to advance U.S. technology,” said Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette. “The Technology Commercialization Fund is a critical component of the Department’s commercialization strategy, meant to provide a bridge that connects America’s innovators to the research and expertise of our world-class National Lab system.”“The TCF model is an important link in the U.S. energy innovation ecosystem, beginning at basic science research and development and reaching maturity in the form of commercial products and services,” said DOE Chief Commercialization Officer and OTT Director Conner Prochaska. “When we allow the nation’s entrepreneurs and creators to harness the full power of our National Lab complex, we build strong connections that energize this process and bolster American competitiveness.”The TCF was created by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to promote promising energy technologies by supporting entrepreneurs’ efforts to engage with the DOE National Laboratory complex. The TCF selections announced today will expand DOE’s efforts to catalyze the commercial impact of the Department’s portfolio of research, development, demonstration, and deployment activities. DOE received over 220 applications for 2020 TCF funding, with project teams engaging more than 130 different partners across multiple diverse disciplines. Teams must receive a 50 percent match of non-federal funds from private partners to receive a TCF award.Electron Energy Corporation, Lanisville, PABoeing, El Segundo, CAKyma Tech, Raleigh, NCSentient
