Award Number: DE-EE0009358CX(s) Applied: A9, A1Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): CAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to Camus Energy to design, develop, and test a cloud-based, open-source situational awareness software platform for understanding energy flow across the grid. Machine learning and data analytics would be used to process data relating to loads/injections at the network endpoints and flows and voltages over the network. They would also be used for integrating observational data with model-based inference to fill gaps and understand the potential consequences of operator actions. Data would be sourced from existing monitoring devices installed on the electric grid.
