Award Number: DE-EE0009366CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): MAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to use machine learning to develop a scalable manufacturing tool to fabricate and process perovskite solar cell films and devices. An open-air rapid spray plasma process (RSPP), which has already been established at Stanford University, would be used to fabricate solar cells. Information such as prior process recipes, physical knowledge, and qualitative evaluations would be incorporated into machine-learning algorithms in order to achieve a scaled-up RSPP.
