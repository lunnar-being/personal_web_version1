The government’s approach to counter proliferation is set out in the 2021 Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy (IR). This highlights the government’s vision for the UK’s role in the world over the next decade and the actions it will take to 2025.

The National Counter Proliferation Strategy (NCPS) also underpins UK actions. The NCPS is under review and a revised version is due to be published in 2021.

This programme aims to contribute towards delivering IR and NCPS objectives. It does this by improving international implementation of obligations set out in major treaties, conventions and regimes to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the illicit transfer of conventional weapons. A significant part of this will be assisting countries to:


  take steps to sign, ratify or join the counter proliferation treaties and regimes
  develop national legislation to give legal effect to the obligations in those treaties and regimes
  develop the capacity to implement those obligations


The programme also seeks to support the international treaties, regimes and organisations which provide important support to international counter-proliferation efforts.

Three broad themes for this year’s programme explained in the programme strategy aim to ensure:


  counter-proliferation norms and treaties work effectively and uphold, preserve and strengthen the Rules Based International System
  increased adherence to international security regimes and treaties; to promote UK values, influence and soft power to address shared proliferation challenges
  control access to materials and knowledge globally to make it as hard as possible for countries or terrorists to develop capabilities
