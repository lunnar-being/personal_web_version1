Government support for renewable CHP has increased the number of such schemes and has diversified the range of CHP prime movers in use.

The additional guidance for renewable CHP has been developed to complement the other guidance and provide additional information to suit the recent developments in renewable CHP. The content in this guide focuses on CHP schemes that use ORC and steam screw expander technologies.
