As a result of the EU Exit transition period ending on 31 December 2020, the rules changed regarding UK residents’ access to healthcare in the EU, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.

From autumn 2021 new agreements have come into force and so the NHS Constitution for England will be updated.


This handbook is designed to give the public, patients, carers, families and NHS staff all the information they need about the NHS Constitution for England.

The handbook covers:


  NHS values and the principles that guide the NHS
  explanations of the rights and pledges in the NHS Constitution
  legal sources of patient and staff rights
  the roles we all play in protecting and developing the NHS
