The UK and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) have agreed a Nuclear Cooperation Agreement (NCA).

This guidance is being updated.

The guidance covers a number of areas, including:


  
BEIS and ONR’s expectations on operators relating to relevant provisions of the Nuclear Safeguards (EU Exit) Regulations 2019

  export licensing requirements


It took effect from 1 January 2021.
