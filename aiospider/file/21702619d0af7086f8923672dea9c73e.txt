 shows that women are chronically underrepresented in the tech sector. While women earn about  of science and engineering degrees, they make up less than  of people employed in these fields globally. And many who enter this career path are commonly  of their gender in a room.To inspire the next generation of women tech leaders, and to celebrate and learn from those who have paved the way in this area, our firm has created a video series featuring five women leaders in STEM: , chair of the board of the NYU Tandon School of Engineering; , co-founder of Entrepreneur First; , CIO of Liberty Mutual; , CEO of Digital14, and , VP of Digital for Commercial at Moderna. Each episode features a McKinsey leader in conversation with these STEM leaders as they share stories of their career journey—and the ways they’re working to bring greater diversity into their field. We are kicking off the series this week with the theme Overcoming challenges—whether that is leading during a pandemic, being the only woman on a team, or embarking on something never done before. Over the next month, we’ll also explore Building diverse teams,” Mentorship & sponsorship,” and Advice to future leaders.”
