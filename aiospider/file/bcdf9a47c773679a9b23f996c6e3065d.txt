Award Number: DE-EE0009250CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Fuel Cell Technologies OfficeLocation(s): MOOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Missouri S&T (MS&T) to develop a steel production system, combining a direct hydrogen reduction furnace for ironmaking (H2DR) with electric melting for steelmaking. The project would seek to develop the system to produce ferrous products (i.e. direct reduced iron (DRI) and hot briquetted iron (HBI)) at a high energy efficiency. The project would be completed over three Budget Periods (BPs), with a Go/No-Go Decision Point in between each BP.
