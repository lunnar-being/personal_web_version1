This guide is for British citizens travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa, work permit or residence permit.

Entry requirements

If you’re going to Latvia to work (or any other EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Latvia) you must make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements.

On the day you travel, you’ll need your passport to both:


  have at least 6 months left
  be less than 10 years old (even if it has 6 months or more left)


If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attend business meetings. These are usually covered by the Schengen visa waiver.

If you’re going for other types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.

Latvia’s authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.


You must always check with Latvia’s government before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements


If you’re working in more than one country you will need to check the entry rules of each country.

If you need a passport, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.

Visa and permit documents

This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in Latvia. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.

It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with Latvia’s immigration authorities or embassy.

You must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:


  translated
  
‘legalised’ (apostillised) or notarised
  originals, or if copies are acceptable
  signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)
  dated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application


Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa.

This guide uses the same terms used in Latvia, so you know which ones to use when speaking to Latvia’s authorities.

Check if you need a visa or permit
You do not need a visa or permit if you’re travelling to Latvia for up to 90 days in a 180-day period for:


  running or attending job interviews
  going to court as a witness
  attending trade fairs
  attending board meetings
  meeting clients or customers (including entertainment like eating at a restaurant)
  meeting colleagues, contractors or sellers
  fact-finding visits
  negotiating, signing and executing deals or contracts
  attending, speaking or presenting at a conference as long as you’re not being paid
  studying
  team-building activities
  visiting business partners
  conducting research or developing professional contacts


Or for the following types of training as long as it’s for the same company or group:


  receiving classroom-based training
  receiving on-the-job training
  shadowing someone’s job


These activities are covered by the Schengen visa waiver.

Border checks

At the border, you may be asked to show:


  proof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets
  health insurance that covers your stay
  proof of accommodation for your entire stay
  enough money for the duration of your trip
  an invitation letter from your employer explaining your trip


Check Latvia’s exemptions

Certain types of work and activities in Europe do not require a visa or permit because they’re exempt.

All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.

The following may not require a visa or permit in Latvia:


  artists and admin staff involved in a touring performance or concert for up to 14 days
  freight and passenger carrier workers, including seafarers
  those invited by an educational or scientific institution to conduct scientific research work, or implement educational programmes, for up to 14 days
  those registered in the Latvian commercial register, a member of a board or council, a proctor such as an agent or attorney, an administrator, a liquidator or member of a company partnership who has the right to represent the partnership, for up to 90 days in a 6-month period
  those authorised to represent a non-Latvian company in activities related to its branch in Latvia, for up to 90 days in a 6-month period
  self-employed work, for up to 90 days in a 6-month period
  temporary work assignments for a UK employer, for up to 14 days in a 180-day period
  trainee internships up to 2 years after completing higher education studies
  traineeship as part of a study programme


EU intra-company transfer permits from other countries
If you have an intra company transfer permit (EU ICT) from another country you can use this to work in Latvia for up to 90 days in a 180-day period.

Your employer has to notify the State Labour Inspectorate and wait for a response before you can start work.

Exemptions are covered by the visa waiver.

Show proof of exemption

You need to be able to show proof that you’re exempt to the authorities on request. This could be:


  an assignment letter
  employment confirmation
  a contract or after-sales agreement
  proof of required qualifications, such as degree and professional certificates
  CV


Further checks
If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from Latvia’s embassy or immigration authorities.

Applying for a visa or permit
This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit to help you prepare, but you’ll need to check the exact rules and processes with Latvia’s immigration authorities or embassy.

Taking your family
You won’t be able to get dependant visas for any family members if you’re working on a Schengen C or national D visa. They may be able to join you for up to 90 days under the visa waiver rules.

There may be different rules for taking families if you have a temporary residence permit.
