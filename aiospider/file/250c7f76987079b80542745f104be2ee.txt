 – Today, the  announced a plan to provide up to $10 million to support frontier plasma science experiments at several plasma research facilities across the nation.“Basic and low temperature plasma science is an important area with many scientific and technological impacts,” said James Van Dam, DOE Associate Director of Science for Fusion Energy Sciences. “The research funded under this initiative will enable the U.S research community to address very important frontier research opportunities and help ensure continued American leadership in this critical field.”The funding opportunity will support research at plasma science facilities at the University of California Los Angeles, University of Wisconsin—Madison, Auburn University, DOE’s Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories, and General Atomics in San Diego. Interested U.S. researchers must have already responded to the separate call for proposals from one or more of these facilities and initiatives and been allocated experimental runtime to carry out the experiments.Total planned funding is $10 million in Fiscal Year 2020 dollars for projects of one to two years in duration.The DOE Funding Opportunity Announcement, and a corresponding call for DOE National Laboratories, can be found on the  of the Office of Fusion Energy Sciences within DOE’s Office of Science.
