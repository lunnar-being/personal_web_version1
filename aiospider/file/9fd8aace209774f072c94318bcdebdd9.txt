Part 5 of the Digital Economy Act 2017 gives government powers to share personal information across organisational boundaries to improve public services. It says what data can be shared and for which purposes. It also includes safeguards to make sure that the privacy of citizens’ data is protected.

How to do this is explained in:


  
    a Code of Practice on Public Service Delivery, Debt and Fraud
  
  
    a Code of Practice for Civil Registration officials
  
  
    a Code of Practice and accreditation criteria for access to data for research purposes
  
  
    Statistics Statement of Principles and Code of Practice on changes to data systems
  


All public authorities and other participants using the information sharing powers in Part 5 of the Digital Economy Act must have regard to the relevant code before any information is shared.

Access the register of information sharing agreements that have been made under the public service delivery, debt, fraud and civil registration provisions within the Digital Economy Act 2017.
