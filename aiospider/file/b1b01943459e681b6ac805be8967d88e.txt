Award Number: DE-EE0009264CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Bioenergy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): COOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to AMP Robotics to develop sensor technology for the characterization of municipal solid waste (MSW). AMP Robotics would develop artificial neural network (ANN) software for use in physical sensors. Sensors, integrated with the software, would then be used to characterize MSW samples in a laboratory setting. Iterative characterization experiments would be performed to further develop the software.
