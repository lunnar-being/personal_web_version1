The past two decades have seen enormous growth in payments systems. Twenty years ago, contactless cards, mobile payments, and digital wallets were in their infancy. Today, they are ubiquitous. But as new payments systems continue to emerge, only a few are likely to survive in the long run. Of more than 200 systems introduced between 1993 and 2000, for instance, only PayPal emerged as a standout success. 

What does it take to create a retail payments offering with staying power? It’s a billion-dollar question with a fundamentally simple two-part answer: large-scale access to stores of value so that senders and receivers can exchange funds, plus a trusted operator that routes transactions between counterparties and enforces fair governance standards. However, the first of these requirements has historically made launching a new scheme difficult for all but incumbents that already manage checking accounts and credit lines.

Incumbents control physical point-of-sale (POS) devices, and extending them to other payments methods is a slow and costly process.
