Calling all manufacturing entrepreneurs! Applications are now open for the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) three Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Programs. These three programs—, , and —are designed to help innovative start-ups develop new manufacturing technologies and take them to market.“DOE’s Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Programs are National Laboratory-based platforms for scientists and engineers to develop and de-risk their hard-tech energy and science concepts while gaining a foothold in the innovation ecosystem,” said Alex Fitzsimmons, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency. “With the support of DOE’s world class National Labs, program alumni have gone on to receive more than $120 million in additional federal and private funding, including Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) awards, philanthropy, angel investors, and venture capital.”To provide participants with the support they need to evolve early-stage R&D innovation into viable businesses, the Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Programs offer:DOE’s Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) wants to hear from scientists and engineers with big ideas that can improve U.S. manufacturing energy efficiency, material productivity, and competitiveness. AMO is particularly interested in ideas that fall into the following five categories, but encourages all innovators with game-changing manufacturing ideas to apply:Take the next step.
