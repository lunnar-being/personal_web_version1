    Regional Fisheries Groups
  

  
  
  
      
  Regional Fisheries Groups (RFGs) are a mechanism for predominantly the inshore fishing fleet to share their views with DEFRA, MMO, Cefas, IFCA and other relevant parties to contribute to discussions on collaborative working. They have in part evolved from Quota Advisory Groups (QAGs) and still incorporate a quota discussion on catch limits. Below you can find notes from recent meetings and dates of forth coming meetings relevant to each region.

Background

In December 2020, Defra and MMO hosted a workshop for the inshore fishing fleet designed to focus discussion on how together, through communication and action, we can produce a model for collaborative working to address regionally specific issues.

Outcomes from the workshop resulted in the creation of Regional Fisheries Groups, discussion focused on the intention of cross sector working, identifying priorities and thoughts on the preferences of local areas. Overall agreement on the concept of Regional Fisheries Groups and the approach was reached.

The incentive for these groups arose as an output from the Future of Inshore Fisheries Conference, and conversations held during Defra’s Inshore Working Group and the MMO’s Quota Advisory Groups.

Concept


  To generate a cultural shift that enables industry to become part of the decision-making process for fisheries management, recognising that industry, government and the recreational sector have a shared vested interest in developing and maintaining a world-class sustainable fisheries management system that supports local communities.


Approach


  To give industry more of an active role in regional decision making and provide an opportunity for them to influence regional fisheries decisions.
  To provide a formal method of engagement predominantly for inshore fishermen and others who may feel they are not represented by a wider national group.
  To build more collaborative and trusting working relationships between policy makers, regulators and the fishing sector at a regional level, recognising the knowledge that they hold.
  To better understand the challenges and opportunities facing the industry at a regional level (particularly the inshore sector) since the UK has become an independent coastal state, so the government can help them to take advantage of opportunities for the future of the industry.


The Regional Fisheries Groups present real opportunities for collaborative working on a range of issues, from Fisheries Management Plans to more localised collaborative science projects to quota management. The membership encompasses MMO, Defra, Cefas, IFCAs, the catching sector and other relevant stakeholders.
