The U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) announced the recipients of EERE’s Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office’s (HFTO’s) inaugural Postdoctoral Recognition Award. The award recognizes postdoctoral fellows from DOE National Laboratories for outstanding contributions in identifying research solutions to hydrogen and fuel cell research challenges.Recognized postdoctoral fellows include:In Spring 2020, HFTO launched the award using a virtual “shark tank” format in which postdoctoral researchers at National Labs pitched their research ideas to HFTO project managers and staff. Presenters received feedback on their project, communications, and presentation skills. The effort aligns with HFTO’s commitment to advance and strengthen the hydrogen and fuel cells workforce in the United States.
