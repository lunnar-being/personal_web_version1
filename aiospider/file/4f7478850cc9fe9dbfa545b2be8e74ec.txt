Award Number: DE-EE0008627CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Water Power Technologies OfficeLocation(s): VAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Columbia Power Technologies, Inc. (CPT) to design, develop, and test a novel low-power wave-energy-converter (WEC). The project would gather system requirements, determine potential energy storage technologies for integration into the WEC, and build on previous research to develop systems and sub-systems. A prototype WEC (previously determined to be the dataRay, but now modified to be the SeaRAY) would be fabricated and tested in open-water to validate its performance. Open water testing was originally proposed for the PacWave North site off the coast of Newport Oregon. Open Testing is now proposed for the Kaneohe Bay site off the island of Oahu. The project would be completed over two Budget Periods (BPs), with a Go/No-Go Decision Point in between each BP.
