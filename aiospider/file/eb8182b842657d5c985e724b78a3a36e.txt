Communication is the  as leaders navigate the unsteady return-to-office phase. We recommend that leaders have a  with employees to help collectively shape the solution, but there’s more to it. While leaders are starting to have these conversations, we have also seen return-to-office announcements that entirely missed the mark. Many announcements to date have been rule based, inflexible, and have treated remote work as a perk, rather than a pandemic necessity that proved to be quite successful for many. The rigidity of communications anchored in policies can feel highly transactional and undermine employees’ sense of being valued—one of the primary factors driving  to report being at least somewhat likely to leave their current positions in the next 3-6 months. Indeed, we heard from several executives that, within a couple weeks of their announcements, they were seeing increasing rates of attrition, particularly amongst new parents and BIPOC employees. Fortunately, there is still time for leaders to get it right. We’ve seen the following five strategies work effectively when determining and communicating return-to-office plans:While there is no singular right way to communicate return-to-office announcements, there are many wrong ways. By leveraging these five strategies, leaders are more likely to land on a better answer that will inspire and engage their people throughout the process—emphasizing the relational, rather than the transactional, aspect of working together.
