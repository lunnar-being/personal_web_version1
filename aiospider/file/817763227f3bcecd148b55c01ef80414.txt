Over the next few years, more than 50 new in vivo and ex vivo gene-therapy launches are already planned. We have already seen cell and gene therapies contribute to some of the most significant disruptions in the pharmaceutical industry. What is their future? What is the outlook for the next wave of innovation for these therapies? Could they disrupt our approach to transplantation, for example, so that patients would no longer need immunosuppression—or even a transplant at all? Could lifelong conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease, be cured through a single injection of a next-generation viral-vector gene therapy? Continuing advances in cell and gene therapies are transforming how we treat and potentially cure certain diseases and dramatically changing healthcare outcomes. What does the next decade look like for this life-changing field of science in bringing transformative solutions, health, and continued hope to patients?
