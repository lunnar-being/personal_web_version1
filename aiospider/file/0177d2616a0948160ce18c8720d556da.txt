The ETEC site is located at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL) in Simi Valley, outside of Los Angeles, California. From the 1950s until 1988, DOE and its predecessor agencies conducted nuclear and liquid metals research at the 90-acre ETEC site. While DOE does not directly own any land at the SSFL (today owned by Boeing), the Department is responsible for demolition of the DOE-owned buildings and cleanup in the 290 acres of the ETEC site and the associated Northern Buffer Zone. Today, there are 18 DOE-ownedbuildings that remain to be addressed, along with final soil and groundwater cleanup activities.In the next 10 years, DOE will focus on demolishing the remaining DOE-owned buildings at the ETEC site, along with initiating soil and groundwater clean-up.In the next 10 years, DOE will focus on demolishing the remaining DOE-owned buildings at the ETEC site, along with initiating soil and groundwater clean-up.
