Award Number: DE-EE0008969CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.3, B3.6Water Power Technologies OfficeLocation(s): MAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Littoral Power Systems Inc. (LPS) to develop a novel fish passage technology that would facilitate upstream passage of both weak and strong swimming fish species. The Zero-Ascend Omnispecies (ZAO) fish passage module would be integrated into a variety of other components/modules to create a fully-functioning fish passage. Specific components of the fish passage module would be developed, fabricated, and tested as part of this project (e.g. transport tube system, entry/exit systems, and ancillaries). Live fish testing would be performed in a laboratory setting to assess their passage through module components.
