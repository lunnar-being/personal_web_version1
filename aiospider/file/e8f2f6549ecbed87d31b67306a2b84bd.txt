Award Number: DE-EE0009351CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): WAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy is proposing to provide federal funding to University of Washington (UW) to develop a forecasting model for all-perovskite tandem solar cell performance using machine learning techniques. The model would use data from solar cell devices to project future cell degradation rates. As part of the project UW would fabricate solar cells and conduct performance testing using the developed cells. Data acquired from these activities would be used to inform forecasting model development.
