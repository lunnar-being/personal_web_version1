Programme closed to applications

The IHRS Programme closed to applications as of 31 July 2020, but runs until March 2022.


About the programme

The Industrial Heat Recovery Support (IHRS) programme was designed to encourage and support investment in heat recovery technologies. This means helping businesses identify and invest in opportunities for recovering and reusing heat that would otherwise be wasted. Recovered waste heat can be used in many ways, helping businesses lower their fuel costs, reduce waste heat and cut emissions. Usage includes:


  within the same industrial facility
  by another end-user (for example a heat network)
  by converting the waste heat to power


The programme objectives were to:


  increase industry confidence to invest in technologies to recover heat from industrial processes
  increase deployment of such technologies in England and Wales


Funding (from a total pot of £18 million) was allocated through a competitive process. Scoring criteria is provided in the programme guidance documents.

The programme was split into 2 phases:


  Phase 1: conceptualise and define the areas where your business could reuse waste heat; assess costs and benefits
  Phase 2: the delivery stage: detailed design, procurement, construction, commissioning, operation start-up and monitoring and evaluation


Projects were funded from 3 different entry points:


  feasibility study and preliminary engineering (Phase 1); or
  preliminary engineering only (for applicants who have already undertaken a feasibility study independent of the IHRS) (Phase 1); or
  detailed design and delivery (Phase 2)


All grant funding was provided in line with state aid rules.
