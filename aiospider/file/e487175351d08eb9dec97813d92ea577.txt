The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) announced today that it will launch a series of listening sessions and events next week to engage the American public in the process of developing a Bill of Rights for an Automated Society.
OSTP Director Eric Lander and Deputy Director for Science and Society Alondra Nelson 
recently announced
 that OSTP is engaging a wide array of stakeholders — in industry, academia, government, civil society, and the general public — in a national endeavor to make sure new and emerging data-driven technologies abide by the enduring values of American democracy.
There are already several ways for the public to join this mission and share their perspectives:





Responses may be submitted to a 
request for information (RFI)
 on current or planned uses of AI-enabled biometric technologies in the private and public sectors until January 15, 2022.
Members of the public can 
email
 OSTP with their comments about the use of artificial intelligence and other data-driven technologies in their lives.





Today, OSTP announced two new ways for the American people to join this effort:





Two public 
listening sessions 
on AI-enabled biometric technologies; and,
Six public 
events
 that will bring together stakeholders to discuss the risks and benefits artificial intelligence holds for democratic participation.





Listening Sessions on Public and Private Sector Uses of AI-Enabled Biometrics
On 
November 18
 and 
November 29
, there will be two public listening sessions, both virtual, on Public and Private Sector Uses of AI-Enabled Biometric Technologies. The purpose of these listening sessions is to understand the past, current, or anticipated uses of biometric technologies; where and how these technologies are being used; who is using them; what current principles, practices, or policies govern their use; and who are, or may be, impacted by their use or regulation. Details for how to join are below:
Biometric Technologies: Listening Session One
When: 
Thursday, November 18, 4:00 p.m. – 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET)
Where:

Public Events on the Bill of Rights for an Automated Society
OSTP is co-hosting six public events to promote public education and engagement on areas where data-driven technologies intersect with the lives of Americans. These events will bring together a variety of practitioners, advocates, and Federal government officials to offer insights and analysis on the risks, harms, benefits, and policy opportunities of AI and other automated technologies. The events offer the public an opportunity to interact with various stakeholders and identify concerns, opportunities, and suggestions to OSTP:
Consumer Rights and Protections:
 This event will explore the opportunities and challenges for individual consumers and communities in the context of a growing ecosystem of AI-enabled consumer products, advanced platforms and services, “Internet of Things” (IoT) devices, and smart city products and services. Panelists will discuss whether the conveniences, enhanced connections, and efficiencies made available through these products and services are benefiting consumers and communities, the trade-offs for consumers and governments, and the effectiveness of existing regulatory and legal protections.
Co-hosts: 
OSTP and The German Marshall Fund of the United States
When:
