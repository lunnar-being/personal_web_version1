As the governmentâ€™s COVID-19 restrictions ease, Filipino consumers are cautiously resuming spending activity. While overall optimism remained the same from April to October, optimism in the lowest income group dropped significantly, while those in the highest income group increased. Optimism among 20- to 24-year-olds also declined. Additionally, approximately 50 percent of respondents believe their finances will be impacted for at least six more months, up from only about 10 percent last April. Overall decreases in spending are expected to soften after the pandemic, but most categories will likely see spending declines linger for the long term.These exhibits are based on survey data collected in the Philippines from April 17 to 20, and October 1 to 12, 2020.
