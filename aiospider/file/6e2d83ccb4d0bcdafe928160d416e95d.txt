This report outlines NFPCG activity during 2019 to 2020 and 2020 to 2021.

The National Falls Prevention Coordination Group (NFPCG) is made up of 40 organisations involved in the prevention and care of falls and fall-related injuries.

This report outlines NFPCG activity during 2019 to 2020 and 2020 to 2021 when coronavirus (COVID-19) had a major impact on both older people and falls services in England.

This is the first such report from the NFPCG. It summarises and makes clear the actions and achievements of this national group over the last 2 years.
