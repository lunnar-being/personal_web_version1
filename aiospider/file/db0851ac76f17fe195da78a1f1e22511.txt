          Details


          

    
            
On behalf of the Home Office (HO), DASA is running a Market Exploration to identify technologies or concept of operations from across the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) spectrum that have the potential for point of contact testing to identify specified drugs, at defined levels, in suspected drug drivers.

Market exploration activities enable us to determine solutions that already exist, novel solutions in development and areas that potentially require further investment. We do this by collecting information to better understand the current market capability in a specific area in order to stimulate the market and shape the focus of any follow on activity.

Whilst this request for information is not a commitment to launch a formal DASA competition in the future, it is envisaged that promising technologies and concepts may influence policy and could be exploited within any subsequent acquisition programmes.
