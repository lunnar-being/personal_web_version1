The anti-dumping duty on ceramic tableware and kitchenware from China was imposed by the EU on behalf of the UK and the other member states. The Secretary of State for International Trade transitioned the anti-dumping duty to continue applying in the UK after the transition period.

A transition review of the anti-dumping duty will be initiated before 16 July 2024.
