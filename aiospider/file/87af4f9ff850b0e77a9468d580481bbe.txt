The Service Interface for Real-time Information Vehicle Monitoring (SIRI-VM) standard is designed to:


  exchange vehicle monitoring information between control systems
  distribute this information to journey planners, alert systems and displays that wish to process and match real-time positions based on structured elements


SIRI-VM provides information about the current location and expected activities of public transport vehicles including:


  current and subsequent journeys
  the calling points on each journey
  the scheduled and expected arrival times


This technical guidance provides an insight into the parts of the SIRI-VM standard that will be captured via the Bus Open Data Service. It is aimed principally at system architects and designers who have a basic understanding of:


  SIRI (CEN EN15531)
  
    other UK and CEN public transport data standards such as Transmodel (EN 12986), NeTEx (CEN TS16614), NaPTAN and TransXChange
