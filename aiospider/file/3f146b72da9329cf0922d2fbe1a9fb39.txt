On December 18, 2020, 11 winners were announced for the , a competition designed to award ideas that have the potential to dramatically lower costs and increase performance of hydropower components and system designs by leveraging advanced manufacturing principles and practices. Each winner, out of a prize pool of $175,000, received a cash prize to further evolve and develop their concept throughout 2021. Ideas were scored based on innovation, impact, and feasibility. The top-placing innovation was Cadens LLC’s “Utility of Large Area AM for Small Hydro,” which involves the design and construction of 3D-printed turbine components via additive manufacturing to produce a low-cost, readily customizable, modular small hydropower system. Other prize-winning concepts included retrofitting of nonpowered dams using 3D concrete printing, additive manufacturing technology paired with modern advances in robotics to enable superior repair, antifouling coating for hydropower cost reductions, and more.Over the last decade, advanced manufacturing has helped revolutionize the energy sector, offering a boost to the U.S. manufacturing industry and opening pathways to increase American competitiveness. Novel applications of advanced manufacturing have ushered in benefits in other energy sectors such as wind and solar and helped industries reach economies of scale and mass production; however, the potential applications for hydropower remain largely unexplored, and thus the benefits remain untapped.WPTO designed this single-stage competition, part of the  series, as a means of identifying high-impact opportunities to apply advanced manufacturing processes and materials to improve conventional hydropower manufacturing—enhancing design flexibility, decreasing energy consumption, lowering costs, and reducing time to market. The prize solicited ideas for advanced manufacturing applications with specific interest in the following categories: joining, coating, and repair; additive and composite manufacturing; casting, forming, and machining; and advanced materials.The I AM Hydro Prize was designed to:Funded by WPTO and administered by NREL and ORNL, the I AM Hydro Prize launched in June 2020 and accepted submissions through October.
