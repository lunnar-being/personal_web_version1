In the US alone, more than 15 million workers have quit their jobs since April 2021. We surveyed employers and employees in Australia, Canada, Singapore, the UK, and the US to find out whatâ€™s driving this mass exodus. The result? Forty percent of the employee respondents said they are at least somewhat likely to quit in the next three to six months. While these findings were broadly consistent across industries, the leisure and hospitality industry are the most at risk for losing employees.
