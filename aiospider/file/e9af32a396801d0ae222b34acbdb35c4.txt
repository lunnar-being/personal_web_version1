All design, development, fabrication and preliminary testing activities would occur in BEMâ€™s research and development facility at the Chestnut Innovation Center in Amesbury, MA. The project activities were originally reviewed by GFO-0008182-001 in August 2017. An additional task has been added to the original SOPO that would include creating webinars, additional field testing of insulation in one or more buildings, and measurement and validation activities. This NEPA review is specific to the project extension (Task 8).
