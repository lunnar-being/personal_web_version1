Development Matters offers a top-level view of how children develop and learn for all early years practitioners, including:


  childminders
  staff in nurseries
  nursery schools
  school nursery and reception classes in school


The guidance can help meet the requirements of the early years foundation stage (EYFS) statutory framework.
