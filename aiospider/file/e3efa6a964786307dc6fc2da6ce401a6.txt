Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be defined as the theory and application of machines—especially computer programs—to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as image labeling and generation, speech recognition and synthesis, natural language understanding and production, as well as various other perception-action based engagements. AI, in its current technological state, is being applied to various industries and domains, such as online advertising, financial trading, medical diagnostics, and robotics. The lucrative market opportunities offered by AI applications have attracted investments from tech giants like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft, as well as research universities and startups.Currently, United States policy with regards to AI often derives from interpretations of various pre-existing legislations and legal precedents. However, there are now policies being crafted around the development and deployment of AI technologies, addressing technology-specific risks and concerns. Acknowledging the trajectory of the technology and its potential applications, there is a pressing need for U.S. legislators and policymakers to remain engaged in the ethical and practical development of artificial intelligence.
