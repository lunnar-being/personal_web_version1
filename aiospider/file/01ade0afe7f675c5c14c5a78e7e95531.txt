          Details


          

    
            
Run by some of the UK’s most selective mathematics universities, maths schools are specialist schools for the most mathematically able 16- to 19-year-olds.

The schools help to prepare students for success in mathematics-related disciplines at top universities, and then to pursue mathematically intensive careers.

The guidance provides information on how to submit an expression of interest, and how to develop a business case for your school. Use the attached form to express an interest in setting up a maths school.

If you have any questions, or need to access the form in an alternative format, email the maths schools team.
