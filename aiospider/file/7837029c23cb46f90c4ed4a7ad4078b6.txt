The partners also will seek to bring more students into the talent pipeline that exists between the two institutions. “By developing strong research partnerships with institutions and faculty members, we can identify opportunities where our unique expertise and facilities can work together on important science and technology missions,” Monarez said. “At the same time, we can provide better internship opportunities to both undergraduate and graduate students with the end goal of bringing on those people as hires.”Several UTEP students participate in PNNL summer internships each year and UTEP has one faculty member currently on appointment with PNNL, with another planned in the near future. There are plans for a PNNL researcher to be placed at the UTEP campus in the future as well.In total, PNNL has over 170  with 44 institutions in the United States and abroad.
