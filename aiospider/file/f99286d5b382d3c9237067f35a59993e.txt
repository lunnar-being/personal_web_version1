Local authority maintained schools must submit the schools financial value standard (SFVS) to their local authority annually.

Local authorities use this information to inform their programme of financial assessment and audit. Local authorities submit an assurance statement every year to cover all the maintained schools in their area.


For the financial year 2021 to 2022:


  schools should submit their SFVS to their local authority no later than 31 March 2022
  local authorities should submit their assurance statement to DfE within 6 weeks, no later than 31 May 2022



Schools financial value standard

The schools financial value standard checklist asks questions of governing bodies in 6 areas of resource management. It links to guidance that provides clarification for each question, examples of good practice, and details of further support available to assist schools in addressing specific issues.

The SFVS checklist guidance and additional resource documents are appropriate for the 2021 to 2022 reporting year. The checklist is very similar to that for the 2020 to 2021 reporting year. One notable change is the inclusion of reporting on related party transactions, in section F.

The self-assessment dashboard that was formerly part of the SFVS has been moved to the benchmarking website.  A question in section E asks if the governing body has considered the results of the dashboard or of other DfE benchmarking tools.

Schools financial value standard assurance

The schools financial value standard assurance statement guidance is for local authorities and explains how to submit the SFVS assurance statement for the 2021 to 2022 financial year.

Self-assessment dashboard

To help complete your checklist, a self-assessment dashboard is available for your school.

The dashboard provides red, amber or green (RAG) ratings against a school’s data that indicates how its spending and characteristics compare with similar schools or nationally recognised bandings and recommendations.

Find your self-assessment dashboard:


  Search for your school(s) on the schools financial benchmarking website

  Click on ‘start a comparison’
  Click on ‘self-assessment dashboard’


Self-assessment dashboard guidance is available if you need help using your dashboard.

Academies

Academies should use the school resource management self-assessment tool.

Send feedback on the tool and guidance to school.resourcemanagement@education.gov.uk.
