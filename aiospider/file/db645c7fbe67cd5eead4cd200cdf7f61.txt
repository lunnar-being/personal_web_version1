          Details


          

    
            
Phase 2 of the Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme provides £75 million of grant funding for the financial year 2021/2022. It has a stronger focus on heat decarbonisation than Phase 1, in order to deliver greater carbon emission reductions. It supports the public sector in taking a ‘whole building’ approach when decarbonising their estates.

Phase 2 opened on 7 April 2021 and closed to applications on 13 April 2021. Projects need to complete by 31 March 2022.

For more information about Phase 2, please see the Salix Finance site.
