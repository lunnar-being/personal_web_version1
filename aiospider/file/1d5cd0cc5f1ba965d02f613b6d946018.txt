Did you know that the Boy Scouts have a merit badge in Nuclear Science? Adam DaeGorn, a scout master in Las Vegas and a Project Manager at the National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Field Office, does. He’s been helping his scouts in Troop 130 understand the mystery of radiation and providing understandable information about the invisible energy.I’ve actually had kids jump back in fear when they hear the clicking of the meter. By the end, I’m listening to these young boys have intelligent conversations about nuclear energy and radiation.“When they first start on the badge we introduce them to naturally occurring radioactive materials such as rocks,” DaeGorn said. “I’ve actually had kids jump back in fear when they hear the clicking of the meter. By the end, I’m listening to these young boys have intelligent conversations about nuclear energy and radiation. It’s no longer something that’s bad.”The fear likely stems from the lack of understanding and perceived danger from radiation, DaeGorn believes. He suggests that his scouts, along with most of the public, receive little education on radiation and its positive and negative effects. As an Eagle Scout himself and scout leader for the past four years, he wants to help his troop members be educated, informed, and aware going forward in life.“Just like I do,” he said. “I want the scouts to respect radiation. When they finish the Nuclear Science merit badge program they now have an awareness of not only the dangers radiation can pose, but of its positive uses and benefits.”
