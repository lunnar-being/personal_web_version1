What to make of maps? How do we understand what information goes into creating them? How can we use them to craft better policy in the Arctic?The Arctic Data Stories workshop will offer a low-stakes, fun environment for students with non-technical backgrounds to explore the interaction between geospatial data and policy. This workshop targets students with and without prior experience in mapping, data visualization, and Arctic research. Thanks to partnerships between HKS' Arctic Initiative, the Woodwell Climate Research Center, and Esri, students will have a rare opportunity to interact with these organizations' experts in policy, climate science, data management, and mapping.Over the course of several weeks, students will learn about topics in data visualization and policy, while gaining literacy in ArcGIS software. Throughout the workshop, students will work in small groups to produce , web-based narratives that contextualize geography, while addressing specific policy questions in the Arctic.
