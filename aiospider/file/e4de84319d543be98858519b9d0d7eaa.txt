The Office of Technology Transitions (OTT) is pleased to provide you with the FY20 Energy I-Corps Annual Report. The Energy I-Corps program, a key OTT initiative, is an intensive two-month training program where National Lab researchers are paired with industry mentors to define technology value propositions, conduct customer discovery interviews, and evaluate potential market applications for their exciting DOE-supported technologies. Energy I-Corps has continuously helped our National Lab community recognize and act on the potentially transformative consequences of their research—for the public good, our economic competitiveness, and our national security.In FY20, we saw promising increases in key areas this including follow-on funding ($83M+), new licensed technologies (60+ licenses) and new ventures launched (12 new businesses) from Energy I-Corps technologies. We were extremely pleased with these results and commend the hard work and persistence of the program’s cohorts. OTT continues to engage with the alumni teams to develop their technologies for further commercial viability.To read more on this dynamic year, follow the download link below. We look forward to another successful year ahead, as we continue to explore new ways to turn research into reality.
