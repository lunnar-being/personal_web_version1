Through its grid-interactive efficient building (GEB) research, BTO seeks to build on existing energy-efficiency efforts and develop technological capabilities to optimize the interplay between building loads and the electric grid. This report analyzes connected lighting systems and consumer electronics/IT equipment technologies. All lighting technologies are assumed to be lighting-emitting diode (LED) or organic LED (OLED) technologies. These technologies are analyzed in two separate sections and the evaluations are not meant to be comparable to each other or other building technologies.
