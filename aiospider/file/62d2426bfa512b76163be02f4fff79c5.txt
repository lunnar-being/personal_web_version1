. – Today, the  announced $17.7 million in funding for Quantum Information Science (QIS) research for nuclear physics. "Because of its enormous potential, research in QIS has become a national priority, and the nuclear science community brings import insights and capabilities to the table," said Dr. Chris Fall, Director of DOE’s Office of Science. "These projects, which can be expected to advance both QIS and nuclear science, are part of a broad national effort to ensure American leadership in this critical emerging field."The seventeen projects cover a wide range of topics, from the use of quantum computing to tackle particularly challenging nuclear physics problems, to the development of superconducting quantum sensors, to the study of radiation effects on the stability of quantum systems. The aim is both to apply nuclear physics expertise to the development of quantum systems and to harness quantum computing and sensing as tools of nuclear science discovery.The awards were made by competitive peer review under a DOE Funding Opportunity Announcement, “,” along with a parallel, companion announcement for DOE laboratories, sponsored by the  within DOE’s Office of Science.Total planned funding is $17.7 million for projects ranging from one to five years in duration, with $7.8 million in currently appropriated funds and outyear funding contingent on congressional appropriations.A list of awards can be found on the NP homepage under the heading, “
