Award Number: DE-EE0009349CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): MDOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to University of Maryland, College Park (UMD) to develop a novel approach for solar photovoltaic (PV) inverter reliability prediction. UMD would utilize inverter field data, computer-based simulations, and inverter component testing to develop the approach. A low (scaled) power PV inverter would be assembled and used as a test bed.
