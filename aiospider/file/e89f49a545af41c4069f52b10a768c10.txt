About this list

This list contains pension schemes that have told HMRC that they meet the conditions to be a recognised overseas pension scheme (ROPS) and have asked to be included on the list.

An updated list of ROPS notifications is published on the first and 15th day of each month. If this date falls on a weekend or UK public holiday the list will be published on the next working day.

Sometimes the list is updated at short notice to temporarily remove schemes while reviews are carried out, for example where fraudulent activity is suspected.

The requirements to be a ROPS changed from 6 April 2017. You’ll need to check that the scheme you’re transferring to on or after that date meets the new requirements.

HMRC cannot guarantee these are ROPS or that any transfers to them will be free of UK tax. It’s your responsibility to find out if you have to pay tax on any transfer of pension savings.

HMRC will usually pursue any UK tax charges (and interest for late payment) arising from transfers to overseas entities that do not meet the ROPS requirements even when they appear on this list.

This includes where the ROPS requirements have changed and where taxpayers are overseas. HMRC will also charge penalties in appropriate cases. Find out about the changes for ROPS requirements.

Tax relief is given on pensions to encourage saving to provide benefits in later life. Accessing benefits (directly or indirectly) before the age of 55 will result in a liability to UK tax charges in all but the most exceptional circumstances.

You should seek suitable professional advice, including from a regulated financial adviser.

HMRC cannot guarantee these are ROPS or that any transfers to them will be free of UK tax. It’s your responsibility to find out if you have to pay tax on any transfer of pension savings. Find out more about Overseas pension schemes.
