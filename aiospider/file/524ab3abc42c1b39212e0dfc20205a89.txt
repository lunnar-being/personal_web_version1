President Biden wants as many Americans as possible to get vaccinated. Doing so is critical to saving lives and helping our country return to normal.





While a significant portion of older generations have received the shot, younger Americans lag behind. It is time for younger generations to get their shot. We’re all in this together: Ensuring that young people join their parents and grandparents and get vaccinated will not only keep them safe, but it will also protect their families and communities by reducing the risk of giving the virus to someone else.





The White House and the U.S. Department of Education are inviting colleges and universities across the country to join us in our efforts to end the pandemic by signing up for the COVID-19 College Vaccine Challenge.  





Participating colleges commit to
 taking three key actions
 to help get their campus communities vaccinated: engaging every student, faculty, and staff member; organizing their college communities; and delivering vaccine access for all.





This effort will build on the program announced by the President Biden on May 11th that matches certain high-enrollment community colleges with partners in the federal pharmacy program to provide vaccination opportunities to students and their communities.





The Challenge also comes on the heels of new federal efforts announced in early May that make it easier and more accessible for Americans across the country to get vaccinated by increasing walk-in vaccinations at local pharmacies; supporting smaller pop-up vaccination clinics and mobile units; providing support for community based organizations to hire the staff needed to increase vaccine access; investing in education efforts about the vaccine in underserved communities, as well state and local vaccine outreach efforts; increasing vaccine availability and outreach efforts, as well as testing and mitigation, in rural communities; and launching a plan to reach newly eligible individuals age 12-15.





Everyone has a role to play in ending this pandemic, including your college or university. As President Biden stated in looking ahead to July 4th: 





In two months, let’s celebrate our independence as a nation, and our independence of this virus. We can do this. We will do this.










The Challenge: 3 Key Commitments





Colleges participating in the COVID-19 College Vaccine Challenge have raised their hands and committed to taking three action steps:










Engage every student, faculty, and staff member





Make sure every member of your campus community knows they are eligible for a vaccine and has resources to find one.










Organize your college community





Lead the way by identifying champions for vaccine efforts across campus and implementing a plan to get as many members of your college community vaccinated as possible.










Deliver vaccine access for all





Meet your community where it is: bring vaccines on-site, and make it easy for students, staff, and faculty to get vaccinated at sites nearby them this summer.










How To Sign Up For The Challenge





Signing up to participate is easy. Below are some FAQs to get you started!

.


			

		

	







	

		

						

				Can  any college or university
 
participate?			

			

		

	


	

		

			

				


Yes! Every college and university in the United States can be a part of this Challenge – and we invite every one of them to be. Many colleges and universities are leading the way and already taking actions like these; we invite every college to join the Challenge as they do so. The more colleges step up and the more momentum we build, the better we reach young people in getting vaccinated. Every vaccination is one step closer back to the campus life we know and love.


			

		

	







	

		

						

				What do I get in taking the pledge and participating in the
 
Challenge?			

			

		

	


	

		

			

				


By participating in the Challenge you help your college, your community, and your country to beat this virus. It’s on all of us to do all we can to get back to normal – and taking responsibility for vaccine efforts in your college community will go a long way towards this goal.





All institutions who sign up and take the pledge will be listed on the White House website, and we will feature Vaccine Champion Colleges throughout the summer in social media, events, and remarks.  We will facilitate events for colleges to learn from each other – panels, communities of practice, and more – and we will provide toolkits, best practices, communications materials for engaging parents, and briefings with Administration officials.


			

		

	







	

		

						

				What about colleges that are already engaged in this
 
work?			

			

		

	


	

		

			

				


Every college and university in the United States can be a part of this Challenge – and we invite every one of them to be.

This Challenge builds on the exemplary leadership of college presidents across the nation, and extends it to all who commit to taking action to increase vaccination rates in their college communities. Taking the pledge to be a Vaccine Champion College can be a part of every colleges’ efforts to plan for the summer and the fall. We want all colleges to step up – as so many already are.
