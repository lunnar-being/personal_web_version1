The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today announced $17.9 million in funding for four research and development projects to scale up American manufacturing of flow battery and long-duration storage systems. This funding will help provide the materials needed to expand the grid with new, clean energy sources, deliver affordable electricity to disadvantaged communities, and help reach the Biden Administration’s goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.“We’re moving at lightning speed to harness renewables and access to long duration storage is critical for dispatching this clean energy for use whenever and wherever it’s needed,” said Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “DOE’s investment to boost battery storage technology coupled with our first-ever Energy Storage for Social Equity Initiative will help generate jobs, build more resilient communities and ensure cleaner, healthier for all Americans.”Flow batteries are electrochemical batteries that use externally stored electrolytes, making them less expensive, safer, and more flexible and adaptable. Selected projects will work to improve manufacturing processes for individual flow battery components and integrate those new or improved components into a prototype system with a mid-sized capacity for grid and industrial applications.Selected Projects Include:This investment is part of  and will be critical to achieving the department-wide  goal of reducing the cost of grid-scale energy storage by 90% within the decade.The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) will fund, support, and manage the selected RDD&D projects. DOE’s Office of Electricity (OE) will fund final testing and validation of selected projects at U.S. national laboratory facilities, including Pacific Northwest National Laboratory’s Grid Storage Launchpad; Sandia National Laboratory's Energy Storage Test Pad, Battery Test Facility, and Battery Abuse Testing Laboratory; and Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Grid Research Integration and Deployment Center.
