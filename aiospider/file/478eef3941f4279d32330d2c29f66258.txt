Animals in Science Regulation Unit (ASRU) Guidance and regulatory advice

You can read ASRU guidance that explains how the act is administered and enforced including detailed regulatory advice for licence holders


  household products testing ban
  guidance on the use of human material in animals
  use, keeping alive and re-use
  harm-benefit analysis
  re-homing and setting free
  working with animals taken from the wild
  code of practice for the care and accommodation of animals
  eﬃcient breeding of genetically altered animals
  severity classification of genetically altered animals
  recording and reporting the actual severity of regulated procedures
  process and standards for establishment full system audits


From 5 July 2021, ASRU now provides regulatory delivery through 3 teams covering different areas each of which has a dedicated inbox. Read the Bridging ways of working guidance (PDF, 160KB, 12 pages) for advice.

Apply for licences

Three licences are required by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (ASPA) before testing on animals is allowed. The 3 licences needed are:


  personal licence for each person carrying out procedures on animals
  project licence for the programme of work
  establishment licence for the place at which the work is carried out


You should use the Animals in Science Procedures e-Licensing (ASPeL) system for all personal and project licence applications.

Contact your establishment’s Home Office liaison contact/administrator to start your application online.

If you are from an establishment that is not yet licensed, email aspa.london@homeoffice.gov.uk.

Any named person responsible for animal welfare on the establishment licence will need to complete a conflict of interest declaration form.

Before applying, please read the standard conditions for personal licences, project licences and establishment licences.

You can also read guidance on:


  improving your project licence application
  data protection impact assessment for the Animals in Science Procedures e-Licensing system


Project Licence Standard Condition 18 notification

All project licences are subject to a set of standard conditions. Standard Condition 18 requires that the project licence holder (PPLh) notifies the Secretary of State as soon as possible if constraints on the severity limits, or observance of other controls described in the licence, have been breached or are likely to have been breached.

You can read the Advice note - Project Licence Standard Condition 18 Notification  (PDF, 544KB, 22 pages), and use the form Project Licence Standard Condition 18 Notification form (ODT, 31.8KB) to make reports.

Annual returns on the use of protected animals

Statistics are collected annually in the UK to meet the requirements of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 to collect and publish statistical information on the use of protected animals in regulated procedures.

If you are a project licence holder, read the guidance on the annual returns process.
