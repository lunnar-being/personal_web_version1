Award Number: DE-EE0008816CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Fuel Cell Technologies OfficeLocation(s): ILOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to Northwestern University for the high-throughput computational discovery, design, lab development and testing of advanced methane and hydrogen storage materials. Project work would occur at Northwestern’s research laboratories in Evanston, IL. Testing and evaluation of these materials for applications in gas storage and studies of guest-host interactions/kinetics would be completed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology research laboratories in Gaithersburg, MD. Additionally, collaboration is expected to occur with the Hydrogen Materials – Advanced Research Consortium (HyMARC).
