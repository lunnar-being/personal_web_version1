“Capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism; it’s exploitation.  Without healthy competition, big players can change and charge whatever they want and treat you however they want.”
President Biden 










For decades, corporate consolidation has been accelerating. In over 75% of U.S. industries, a smaller number of large companies now control more of the business than they did twenty years ago.





That lack of competition drives up prices for consumers and drives down wages for workers.





Families are paying higher prices for necessities—things like prescription drugs, hearing aids, and internet service. And when there are only a few employers in town, workers have less opportunity to bargain for a higher wage and to demand dignity and respect in the workplace. In total, higher prices and lower wages caused by lack of competition are now estimated to cost the median American household $5,000 per year.





President Biden signed 
a historic Executive Order
 to establish a whole-of-government effort to promote competition in the American economy. 





Here are the actions that the administration has already taken to-date to increase competition and deliver concrete benefits to America’s consumers, workers, farmers, and small businesses:
