Three novel energy-efficient drying technologies would be used as the basis for the development of smart drying prototypes for drying food, pulp and paper. These drying technologies would be developed at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and the University of Illinois. The project would be completed over three Budget Periods (BPs). This NEPA determination is applicable to all three BPs.
