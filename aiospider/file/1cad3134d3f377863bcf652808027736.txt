Every major improvement in American manufacturing productivity has been achieved through technological innovation. Today, as manufacturers grow more reliant on computers to manage their processes, high-performance computing presents an opportunity for the next great leap in productivity.The U.S. Department of Energy's  (HPC4Mfg), funded by the  (AMO), helps American manufacturers make use of the world's most powerful supercomputers and the National Laboratory experts who run them.High-performance computing (HPC) allows researchers to perform a wider range of virtual experiments than the traditional laboratory testing environment. Using advanced modeling, simulation, and data analysis, supercomputers provide manufacturers with the information they need to save time, energy, and resources. These insights can improve both the competitiveness and the energy efficiency of American manufacturing—a vital step on our path to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.Since the program's inception in 2015, 95 manufacturers from a range of industries have turned to the HPC4Mfg program for solutions to complex manufacturing challenges, including:
