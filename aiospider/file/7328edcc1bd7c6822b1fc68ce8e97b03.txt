Now in its sixth year, the ATB documents technology-specific information on a broad spectrum of electricity-generation technologies—wind, solar, geothermal, hydropower, biopower, coal, natural gas, nuclear, and battery storage. In addition to updates to technology-specific data, this year’s ATB website update also offers an improved user experience with expanded features, including interactive, downloadable charts.
