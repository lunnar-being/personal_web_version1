Two possibilities for Africa’s greenhouse gas emissions, two radically different paths. In the base-case scenario, Africa’s emissions would rise by 70 percent by 2050. But to get to net-zero emissions implies a 90 percent reduction from 2018 levels. Something in between may be more likely: if Africa’s manufacturers follow the planned path of national determined contributions (NDCs), emissions may fall by about 25 percent.
