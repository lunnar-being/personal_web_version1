Levelized cost of energy reductions across the three wind applications studied are relative to 2019 baseline values (see Figure 1). Offshore wind is expected to experience the greater relative cost reductions compared to onshore wind. Over time, the cost difference between fixed-bottom and floating offshore wind is expected to narrow. Experts now anticipate that by 2050, onshore and offshore costs will be half of what had been earlier predicted in 2015.Figure 1. Estimates of future levelized costs for wind energy under the median scenario, based on responses to a global expert survey (MWh: megawatt-hour).“All else being equal, these trends will enable wind to play a larger role in global energy supply than previously thought, while facilitating energy-sector decarbonization,” said Berkeley Lab coauthor Joachim Seel. “Analysts, investors, and energy system planners should avoid using outdated assumptions and forecasts.”Figure 2.
