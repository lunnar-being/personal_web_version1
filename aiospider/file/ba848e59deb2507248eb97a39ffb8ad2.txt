These guidelines were last updated in April 2016 and do not necessarily reflect current guidance. 
Following a review of the future of the guidelines by Department
for Environment
Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Planning Inspectorate it has been decided that a single source of policy guidance issued by Defra would be more appropriate, efficient and user friendly. Defra will incorporate essential policy elements of the Consistency Guidelines into Circular 1/09 when they revise it.
