Award Number: DE-EE0009247CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6, B3.15Fuel Cell Technologies OfficeLocation(s): INOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Cummins Inc. to design, develop, and test a new modular polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack to power heavy duty (HD) applications. The stack would be designed to run at high pressure and tolerate high temperatures during peak power excursions. The project would be completed over two Budget Periods (BPs) with a Go/No-Go Decision Point between the two BPs.
