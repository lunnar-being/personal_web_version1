The Defense Department's research and development laboratories design new tools for cyber defense, evaluate new concepts for autonomous vehicles and advance military-critical technology in areas such as advanced computing, "big data" analytics, artificial intelligence, autonomy, robotics, directed energy, hypersonics and biotechnology.Some of this innovative work was on display last week during the third biennial DOD Lab Day at the Pentagon. Lab Day is a chance for DOD to showcase the work being done by its scientists and engineers to benefit warfighters.




DOD's science, technology, engineering and mathematics personnel are given the latitude and the responsibility to try to answer challenges. Their work leads to technologies that make warfighters a more lethal and protected force.The labs are the foundation for research to support the nation's defense. Private industry has built upon knowledge discovered by DOD and developed tools and conveniences for everyday use.




DOD's STEM workforce is made up of people who love solving problems, which makes them an ideal fit for the DOD labs, because they have some of the most challenging problems out there.
