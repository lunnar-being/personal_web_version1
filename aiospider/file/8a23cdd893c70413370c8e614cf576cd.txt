Award Number: DE-EE0008981CX(s) Applied: A9Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): NCOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) to perform techno-economic modeling/analysis on new and future technologies that are expected to be integrated into utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) plants. Component cost and performance data would be assessed and used to create an optimization tool (i.e. software) to aid in solar PV plant configuration.
