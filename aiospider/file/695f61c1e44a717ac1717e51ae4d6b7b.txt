Award Number: DE-EE0008629CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Water Power Technologies OfficeLocation(s): HIOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to the University of Hawaii (UofH) to design, fabricate, and test a novel wave energy converter (WEC) device. The device would be developed so as to readily incorporate a commercially available hydro turbine into a novel WEC configuration. Small and medium-scale prototype devices would be developed and tested both in near-shore ocean waters and at dedicated wave tank testing facilities.
