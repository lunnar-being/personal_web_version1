          Details


          

    
            
On 19 July 2020, we announced the successful proposer groups to open and run 37 or the 39 new special and alternative provision free schools. These schools were part of the joint special and alternative provision free schools wave, where we asked local authorities to set out their case for why a new school would benefit their area. As a result, we selected 39 local authorities where we invited applications to establish a special or alternative provision school.

Two of the competitions for special free schools in Bromley and Shropshire failed to appoint a trust, so we are relaunching these 2 competitions. The specifications for the competitions can be found on the local authority websites for:


  
    Shropshire
  
  
    Bromley
  


More information on opening a free school is available.

Contact the New Schools Network if you need more advice on how to set up a free school.
