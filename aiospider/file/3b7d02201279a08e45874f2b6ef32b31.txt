This guide is for British citizens travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa, work permit or residence permit.

Entry requirements

If you’re going to Slovenia to work (or any other EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) you must make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements.

On the day you travel, you’ll need your passport to both:


  have at least 6 months left
  be less than 10 years old (even if it has 6 months or more left)


If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attend business meetings. These are usually covered by the Schengen visa waiver.

If you’re going for other types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.

Slovenia’s authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.


You must always check with Slovenia’s government before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements


If you’re working in more than one country you’ll need to check the entry rules of each country.

If you need a passport, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.

Visa and permit documents

This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in Slovenia. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.

It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with Slovenia’s authorities or embassy.

All documents should be:


  provided as originals or certified copies
  translated into Slovenian


You must also check if documents should be:


  ‘legalised’ (apostillised)
  notarised
  signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)
  dated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application


Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa. This guide uses the same terms used in Slovenia, so you know which ones to use when speaking to Slovenia’s authorities.

Check if you need a visa or permit

You do not need a visa or permit if you’re travelling to Slovenia for up to 90 days in a 180-day period for:


  attending job interviews
  engaging in activities to establish a market presence in Slovenia
  conducting research or developing professional contacts
  attending a board meeting
  attending a trade show, seminar or workshop (unpaid) without selling or supplying goods to customers
  attending, speaking or presenting at a conference (unpaid)
  meeting clients, customers, business partners or colleagues
  attending meetings with contractors or vendors
  entertainment (within the context of networking and strengthening your relationship with the client)
  fact-finding visits
  troubleshooting machinery or hardware and software issues
  signing, negotiating and executing deals or contracts


These activities are covered by the Schengen visa waiver.

Border checks

At the border, you may be asked to show:


  proof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets
  international health insurance that covers your stay
  proof of accommodation for your entire stay
  enough money for the duration of your trip
  an invitation letter from your employer explaining your trip


Register with the Slovenian police

If you’re travelling on a visa waiver, and plan to stay for more than 3 days (even as a tourist), you must register where you’re staying with the local police and inform them when you leave. You need to do this in person.

If you’re staying in a hotel or guest house, they will register you when processing your arrival.

If you’re staying with friends or family, your host can register you online if they have a digital certificate.


You do not need to register with the police if you’re applying for a visa or permit.


Check Slovenia’s exemptions

Certain types of work and activities do not require a visa or permit because they’re exempt.

All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.

You may not need a visa or permit if you’re in Slovenia for up to 90 days in a year for:


  coaches and professional sports people taking part in sports competitions
  foreign media reporters or correspondents
  service providers contracted to work for the Ministry of Defence or Ministry of the Interior on security and defence of the state, including those training in these areas
  crew members of a ship or aircraft, or road or railway transport as long as you’re employed outside of Slovenia
  tour guides or tour leaders accompanying tourist groups or mountain guides – your activities must comply with the laws governing tourist and mountain guides
  those working in Slovenia’s interest in the fields of economy, education, science or culture
  priests, nuns or monks from registered religious communities
  organisers of charitable and humanitarian activities for recognised humanitarian organisations or registered religious communities
  company founders or supervisory board members registered as such in the Slovenian court register – this does not include registered company representatives
  service providers in the cultural sector participating in art workshops, meetings, ‘art colonies’ or other cultural events, including reporters for such events
  representatives of a company listed in the Slovenian business register – your employer needs to submit an online notification to the employment service in Slovenia before you start working


Also, collaborators, creators or interpreters in the fields of:


  music and musical performance
  dance
  literary arts
  visual arts, such as photography, video and film, electronic media art, architecture and design and inter-media art
  performing arts
  experts in cultural heritage preservation, librarianship, archival science, including accompanying teaching, reporting, organisational or technical staff


After-sales work

Those carrying out work from an after-sales agreement for up to 14 consecutive days a year or a total of 90 days within a 1 year-period.

Your employer needs to submit an online notification to the employment service in Slovenia before you start working.

EU intra-company transfer (EU ICT) permit holders

If you have an EU ICT from another country you can work in Slovenia for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. Your employer will need to notify the Slovenian Labour Authority (employment service) within 8 days of you moving to Slovenia.

You can check with the Administrative Units Service if your work is exempt. They can confirm within 15 days whether you can work without a full work permit.

Exemptions are covered by the Schengen visa waiver.

Show proof of exemption


  an assignment letter
  employment confirmation
  a contract
  proof of required qualifications, such as diploma and professional certificates
  CV
  proof of registration in the company’s register if you’re travelling as a legal representative for a company


Register with the Slovenian police

If you’re travelling on a Slovenian exemption, and plan to stay for more than 3 days (even as a tourist), you must register where you’re staying with the local police and inform them when you leave. You need to do this in person.

If you’re staying in a hotel or guest house, they will register you when processing your arrival.

If you’re staying with friends or family, your host can register you online if they have a digital certificate.


You do not need to register with the police if you’re applying for a visa or permit.


Further checks

If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from Slovenia’s embassy or immigration authorities.

Applying for a visa or permit

This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit to help you prepare, but you’ll need to check the exact rules and processes with  Slovenia’s immigration authorities or embassy.

Taking your family

If you have a spouse and any children under 18 they can join you immediately if you have an EU Blue Card, EU ICT or permit to work as a researcher, a higher education teacher or assistant.

For the other permits listed in this guide family members will need to get approval from the relevant ministry   if they want to join you immediately.

They may be able to join you for up to 90 days on a visitor visa or under the visa waiver rules.
