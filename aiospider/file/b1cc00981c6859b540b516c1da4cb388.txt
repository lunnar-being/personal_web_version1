          Details


          

    
            
On behalf of the Home Office (HO), DASA is running a Market Exploration to identify technologies from across the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) spectrum which have the potential to stop or prevent E-Scooters and E-Bikes from being used to commit criminal acts.

We are undertaking this Market Exploration in order to provide UK Policing with an understanding of capabilities that currently exist, or innovative ideas that require further development, which could advance on existing methods.

Whilst potentially successful technologies and concepts may be exploited within future acquisition programmes, please note that this request for information is not a commitment to subsequently launch a formal DASA competition .
