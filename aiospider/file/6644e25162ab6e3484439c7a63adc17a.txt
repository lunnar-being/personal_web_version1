About the scheme

The Workplace Charging Scheme (WCS) is a voucher-based scheme that provides eligible applicants with support towards the upfront costs of the purchase and installation of electric vehicle (EV) chargepoints. After an applicant applies, installers claim the grant on their behalf.

It is available in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but not in the Channel Islands or Isle of Man.

The scheme is run by the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (OZEV) and administered by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).

This guidance is aimed at installers. Guidance for manufacturers  and applicants is also available.

How the scheme works

The WCS is open to businesses, charities and public sector organisations that meet the applicant and site eligibility criteria set out in the guidance for applicants.

The grant covers up to 75% of the total costs of the purchase and installation of EV chargepoints (inclusive of VAT), capped at a maximum of:


  £350 per socket
  40 sockets across all sites per applicant – for instance, if the customer would like to install them in 40 sites, they will have 1 socket available per site


After applying using the online application form, successful applicants are issued with a unique identification voucher code by email, which can then be given to any OZEV-authorised WCS installer.

Once the chargepoint(s) have been installed, the authorised installer can claim the grant from OZEV on the applicant’s behalf via the online installer service.

The chargepoint installation must be completed and the voucher claimed within 6 months of the voucher’s issue date. Claims against expired vouchers will not be paid.

Installers must not charge applicants for the grant in advance of payment being made by OZEV. After OZEV reimburses you for the value of the voucher, you must discount this cost from your customer’s final invoice.

If the customer applies for less than 40 sockets, they can submit additional applications in the future until they reach that limit. Special rules apply for linked enterprises.

OZEV reserves the right to terminate or change the rules of this grant scheme – including the grant level – at any time, although we will endeavour to provide up to 4 weeks’ notice. OZEV will honour any voucher codes that have been issued ahead of any changes to the grant or during any notice period given following the announcement of the scheme’s closure.

Changes to the latest version

The main change from the previous version is the removal of the need for the installer to be approved by a manufacturer to install their chargepoints.

The chargepoints installed must be on the WCS approved chargepoint list.

Definitions

Applicant

A party who has declared an existing or future need for charging infrastructure. For the purposes of this scheme, an applicant can be any eligible business, charity or public sector organisation.

Applicants must meet the terms and conditions of the scheme and have permission to install charging infrastructure at designated off-street parking facilities dedicated to staff and/or fleet use.

Authorised installer

A party that has been authorised to install EV chargepoints by OZEV under the WCS through the process outlined in How to become an authorised installer. Installers manage the installation of chargepoints at applicant sites.

The term ‘installer’ in this guidance means ‘authorised installer’.

Authorised installer representative

A party that has been authorised to sub-contract to installers the installation of chargepoints under the WCS by OZEV.

The authorised installer representative remains wholly responsible for ensuring that the installers abide by the relevant terms and conditions of the scheme. If an authorised installer representative’s installer fails to meet the terms and conditions, OZEV may revoke the authorisation of the authorised installer representative.

Authorised chargepoint manufacturer

A party that manufactures chargepoints that have been authorised under the WCS by OZEV through the process outlined in How to get chargepoint approval for manufacturers.

Staff and/or fleet parking

Off-street parking that is designated to the applicant and is for their staff or fleet, and not for customer use. Applicants must be able to provide evidence of this on request (for example, details of a parking policy or photographic evidence).

The parking facilities must be clearly associated with the applicant’s premises and be either on-site or a reasonable distance from the place of work.

Customer parking

Parking that is available to be used by the applicant’s customers. Customer parking is not eligible for the WCS.

Chargepoint socket (also referred to as ‘chargepoints’ or ‘chargepoint units’)

Sockets that are used to charge an EV. There are 4 modes of EV chargepoint socket, and mode 3 and 4 are eligible for WCS. Each socket must have at least a 3kW supply undiminished by simultaneous charging.

Modes 1 and 2 (such as a normal 3-pin socket) are not eligible. For more information, refer to the minimum technical specification.

Eligibility and technical requirements

Installer authorisation

Installers must apply online for OZEV authorisation before they can install chargepoint units under the WCS (and its domestic equivalent, the EVHS).

Learn how to become an authorised installer.

Customer eligibility

The scheme is open to applicant organisations that fulfil all of the grant eligibility criteria outlined in the guidance for applicants.

Applicant eligibility

The applicant organisation must:


  be a registered business, charity or public sector organisation
  either:
    
      be a public authority

      have received – or have currently pending at the time of application – less than €200,000 of public support in the last 3 financial years and satisfy the state aid requirements for de minimis aid

    
  
  declare a need for EV charging equipment, or an intent to encourage uptake among their staff and/or fleet
  be located in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland (applicants in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man are not eligible)
  have dedicated off-street parking for staff and/or fleet use only
  own the property or have consent from the landlord for chargepoints to be installed at all the sites listed in the application


Site eligibility

Each site must:


  have a minimum power supply of 3kW to each individual socket that is not diminished by their simultaneous use
  have no more than one socket installed for each accessible parking space
  be for staff and/or fleet use


If your customer’s primary place of work is also a residential property (their home), they can apply for the grant under this scheme as long as their address is listed as their place of business with Companies House or HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).

The following sites are not eligible for the scheme:


  locations outside England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland (including the Channel Islands and Isle of Man)
  parking facilities that are part of a domestic property (and it is not a primary place of work) – your customers may be able to apply to the EVHS instead if they are looking to install an EV chargepoint in a residential dwelling
  where the site of installation is an address that has claimed previously under the EVHS or Domestic Recharging Scheme (DRS)
  parking facilities that are solely for customer use
  parking facilities not designated to the applicant
  parking facilities that have not yet been built – only existing designated off-street parking is eligible for the scheme; a confirmation letter (from, for example, your local council) does not oblige the applicant to proceed with the construction and OZEV, therefore, cannot rely on it as evidence


OZEV will not grant exceptions for locations that do not meet these eligibility criteria.

OZEV cannot provide bespoke advice on eligibility. Before your customer applies for a voucher, you should check that they qualify for the scheme by:


  discussing their individual circumstances and intended chargepoint models with them
  undertaking a survey of any prospective site(s)


Chargepoint equipment requirements

All chargepoint units must meet the minimum technical specification and be on the WCS-approved chargepoint model list at the time of installation.

Learn more about the chargepoint approval process for manufacturers.

Ensure that the chargepoint model name is exactly the same as the one stated on the eligible list. Claims will be rejected if the model claimed is not on the list.

Chargepoints are listed at the request of their manufacturers. If a model is not listed, it is not eligible for grant. Contact the chargepoint manufacturer:


  to find out why your chargepoint is not listed
  for details on what is covered by a specific approval


A customer may provide their own chargepoint if it is on the WCS approved chargepoint model list and they have a manufacturer’s 3-year on-site warranty. However, such equipment will not be eligible for a grant under the WCS. In this instance, as an installer, you may only claim for the cost of labour and other parts provided for the installation.

You cannot claim against:


  a previously installed or second-hand chargepoint – the chargepoint unit must be new
  installations made prior to voucher approval – applicants must apply for a voucher before you install any chargepoints


Installation requirements

Installations under WCS can only be completed by installers that have been authorised by OZEV. Learn how to become an OZEV-authorised installer.

Installations must be completed and a claim made before the voucher expires. A voucher will be valid for 6 months (180 days) from the date of issue.

Installations must meet the minimum technical specification.

Authorised chargepoint installers must confirm that installations will be carried out in accordance with current:


  BS EN 61851-1:2019
  Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) Wiring Regulations – currently BS 7671:2018+A1:2020

  IET Code of Practice for Electric Vehicle Charging Equipment Installation
  Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations 2002
  all other applicable standards


The installation must also consider the requirements of BS 8300:2009+A1:2010 and the needs of disabled people.

Charging equipment installed must:


  meet the applicable minimum ingress protection (IP) ratings set out in BS EN 61851-1:2019 and BS 7671:2018+A1:2020 according to the usage location
  be supplied with an on-site 3-year warranty on parts and installation, and a BS7671 Electrical Installation Certificate



If the customer encounters any issues within the warranty period, they should contact their chargepoint installer or manufacturer.

Accessibility needs

When installing EV chargepoints, it is important to consider who may use them, particularly EV owners who may be disabled or have mobility issues.

All installations taking place under the WCS should consider the requirements of BS 8300-1:2018 (Design of an accessible and inclusive built environment – External environment. Code of practice) and the requirements of disabled people or those with mobility issues.

On-site audits

The installer of the chargepoint equipment may be subject to audit to ensure they have complied with the relevant provisions in the minimum technical specification, which may involve a site visit.

Failure to provide all relevant, accurate evidence of compliance may result in further action against the authorised installer making the claim. OZEV reserves the right to make final judgements on eligibility based on the evidence provided. This includes removing authorised installers who fail to install chargepoints according to WCS standards.

Find out more about audits and the evidence required.

Ongoing data requirements

All sites must be able to communicate usage data to a back-end management system to enable it to be sent onwards to OZEV. The communication channels may include but are not limited to:


  general packet radio services (GPRS) or cellular networks
  other wireless means
  wired network connectivity – optionally using a virtual private network (VPN)


Problems with signal strength

If using cellular or GPRS where the network capacity is not sufficient (such as low-quality network coverage via GPRS), installers must use additional means to boost the signal strength.

Problems with data supply

If data communication is not possible, you must declare this when submitting a claim on the online installer portal.

OZEV will monitor the number of installations from installers without data communications and reserves the right to request more information from any installers that are not communicating the required data. This may result in your authorisation being revoked.

Notifying your distribution network operator of installations

You must notify your local distribution network operator (DNO) of all installations you make so that they can evaluate the potential load on the grid and any network reinforcements. This notification must be compliant with the relevant DNO’s requirements.

If you do not notify the relevant DNO(s) of chargepoints installed under the WCS and do not retain evidence of this notification, your authorisation may be revoked.

In your notification, you should either submit to each relevant DNO:


  an online form per installation
  a list of installations (with relevant details) in a single spreadsheet


Multiple notifications are encouraged.

The online form and multi-notification spreadsheet template, plus the regions each DNO covers and their contact details, can be found on the Energy Networks Association (ENA) website.

You must keep your online account up to date. This includes your contact details.


How to redeem a customer voucher


Make a claim under the Workplace Charging Scheme

You can redeem a WCS voucher via the online installer portal.


Overview of redemption process

The following is a summary of the process authorised installers must follow to redeem a customer’s voucher and install chargepoints under the WCS.

1. Installer receives enquiry from applicant and checks their WCS voucher code is eligible via the online installer portal.

2. Installer completes site surveys and quotes, and confirms sites are suitable for their customer’s intended chargepoint installations.

3. Installer installs OZEV-approved chargepoint unit(s) in line with the WCS minimum technical specification, switches them on, and verifies they are working safely and communicating data.

4. Installer completes online grant redemption on the online installer portal before voucher expires, including:


  declaring installation costs
  providing photographic evidence of installation


5. Installer notifies the relevant DNO in agreement with ENA and supplies the customer with a copy of the BS7671 Electrical Installation Certificate.

6. The applicant will receive an email from DVLA containing the information provided by the installer and confirming the grant level generated by the system.

7. Applicant checks the details in installer email are accurate:


  if they are inaccurate, the applicant has 7 calendar days to email workplacechargingscheme@dvla.gov.uk and raise any concerns – DVLA may then contact the installer with queries
  if they are accurate, OZEV pays the installer


8. DVLA processes an installer WCS claim in 7 working days, subject to any queries. The installer responds promptly to any queries.

9. Installer receives grant from OZEV within 30 working days. If the installer has not previously claimed any grants from OZEV, payment may take up to 3 months to process.

10. Installer retains copies of all customer details and required documents. If chosen for audit check, the installer sends OZEV all requested documentation

Information you need to provide in your claim

During the WCS voucher redemption process, you must provide:


  the make and model(s) of chargepoint unit(s) installed. Ensure these match those stated on the OZEV-approved chargepoint list) exactly
  the costs incurred (these will be used to compute the exact value of the grant, which will be equal to 75% of the installation and purchase costs of a chargepoint up to a maximum of £350)
  a photo of the chargepoint unit(s) with the serial number clearly visible (up to 5MB in size)
  a photo of the parking site with all the chargepoint units visible (up to 5MB in size)


Voucher code validity and when you should submit your claim

As soon as you receive an enquiry from a WCS applicant, you should request to see their voucher code to confirm their eligibility.

You can check that a voucher code is eligible by checking the voucher code on the online installer portal or by contacting workplacechargingscheme@dvla.gov.uk. We recommend you do this as early as possible.

Your customer’s voucher will contain a unique code that you will need to reference to make a successful claim. It will also provide:


  their contact details
  the installation site(s)
  the expiry date
  the number of sockets and sites for which the voucher is valid


The online redemption process will only start when you formally input the voucher code into the portal and submit your claim.

You must submit a claim by midnight on the date the voucher associated with the installation expires. Each voucher is valid for 6 months (180 days) from its date of issue.

Late claims, or claims without a voucher code, will not be paid.

For applicants that complete installations across a number of their premises, the maximum number of chargepoint sockets that can be claimed is 40 regardless of the number of sites. All installations under a single voucher must be claimed in a single claim. Once a voucher has been redeemed it cannot be re-used. If there are other sites linked to a redeemed voucher at which a chargepoint has not been installed, an applicant must reapply for a new voucher for these sites.

If the installation (or part of it) cannot be completed by your voucher’s expiry date

If all installation(s) listed cannot be completed within the 6-month period specified on the voucher, the applicant will need to withdraw their application and reapply for a new voucher. Vouchers are non-transferable.

If some chargepoints on the voucher have been completed by the expiry date but others have not, you can claim for the installations that you have completed, but your customer will need to reapply for a new voucher for the remaining installations not yet completed. In these circumstances, installations completed before the new voucher has been issued will not be eligible.

Value of support

WCS provides a grant equal to 75% of the purchase and installation costs of a chargepoint, capped at a maximum of £350 for each socket, up to a limit of 40 sockets per applicant.

The WCS’s capping system calculates 75% of the declared costs (inclusive of VAT) and will allocate a grant equal to whichever is lowest: 75% of the costs or £350.

Please remember to take this into consideration when agreeing a certain price with your customers. OZEV will not be held responsible if the final grant level is not in line with the estimations or quotes you provide.

Maximum number of chargepoints per customer

You may complete installations for a customer across a number of their premises. In this case, the maximum number of chargepoint sockets that you can claim is 40, regardless of the number of sites.

All installations under a single voucher must be claimed in a single claim.

Once a voucher has been redeemed, it cannot be re-used. If there are other sites linked to a redeemed voucher at which a chargepoint has not been installed, an applicant must reapply for a new voucher for these sites.

Costs

Detail of the costs incurred must be submitted by the installer and confirmed by the applicant in order for a claim to be successful. Checks will be made regularly on the details submitted.

Installers must not:


  charge applicants for the grant in advance of payment being made by OZEV

  inflate the costs of the chargepoints to benefit from a higher grant level
  use the grant to cross-subsidise costs incurred in other parts of its business


Any evidence of non-compliance with the above will be acted on by OZEV – see penalties for improper conduct.

We have designed the scheme to be as simple for the applicant as possible. By authorising chargepoint installers and enabling them to claim on behalf of applicants, we are ensuring value for money for the taxpayer and reducing the risk of fraudulent activity by individuals.

If an installer enters administration, payment would be made by OZEV to administrators.

How to appeal if your claim is rejected

If your claim is unsuccessful, you may appeal by emailing the DVLA at workplacechargingscheme@dvla.gov.uk with reasons why you believe the decision should be re-examined. A manager at OZEV will then consider the appeal. The outcome of this appeal is final.

If the applicant’s circumstances have changed

If the applicant contacts you to inform you that their circumstances have changed since they originally applied, you must ensure they are still eligible to have a chargepoint installed under the scheme.

They may need to reapply for a voucher.

If this change of circumstances invalidates your customer’s application and we have reason to believe you were aware of this prior to installation, OZEV reserves the right to take any action it deems appropriate to reclaim the grant.

Grant payment processing times

First-time applicants

First payment(s) may take up to 3 months to process following your first WCS claim.

This is because, when an installer redeems the voucher successfully for the first time, they need to be set up as a vendor on the Department for Transport (DfT) finance system.

You may be asked to verify the bank account details you provided at the time you initially applied for installer authorisation and, while DfT aims to do this as quickly as possible, any inaccuracy in the information provided or delay in responding may result in a delay to your payment.

Subsequent claims

Claims are processed on a fortnightly basis (typically at the beginning of the month and mid-month), following the conclusion of the 7-day confirmation period, and we aim to pay the grant amount to installers within 30 working days of this date.

For instance, if you complete the online redemption process on 15 April, the voucher redemption details will be deemed accepted by the applicant after 7 days (22 April) and OZEV will aim to pay this voucher at the beginning of the following month (May).

Similarly, if you complete your claim on 24 April, the voucher redemption details will be deemed accepted by the applicant after 7 days (1 May) and OZEV will aim to pay this voucher after mid-May.

Installer responsibilities

Only OZEV-authorised installers can claim the grant on behalf of the applicant.

For each installed workplace chargepoint, the installer must:


  ensure that the applicant meets the eligibility criteria

  ensure that the installed chargepoint model is approved by OZEV

  ensure that the installed chargepoint is tested to verify it’s fully functioning, can communicate usage data to a back-end management system to enable it to be sent onwards to OZEV and meets safety requirements
  ensure that the voucher is redeemed via the online installer portal within the expiry date
  ensure that the supply, distribution equipment, chargepoint cabling and installation meet the WCS’s minimum technical specification, and record and retain photographic evidence of this
  retain all documentation pertaining to the installation for a minimum of 3 years, including:
    
      installation and commissioning confirmations and certificates
      photographs
      customer declarations, signatures and full address
      dates of installation
    
  
  ensure the same chargepoint is not claimed for twice
  notify the DNO of the installation in writing
  issue a BS7671 Electrical Installation Certificate



Installers must not:


  charge applicants for the grant in advance of payment being made by OZEV

  inflate the costs of the chargepoints to benefit from a higher grant level
  use the grant to cross-subsidise costs incurred in other parts of its business


Penalties for improper conduct

Where on behalf of an installer, OZEV reserve the right to withhold payment pending further investigation to ensure public funding is not being used incorrectly.

OZEV reserves the right to withhold payment from the installer pending further investigation where there is reasonable evidence to suggest:


  improper conduct on the part of the installer
  the installer was aware of changes in circumstances that invalidate the applicant’s eligibility under the WCS and failed to inform OZEV



OZEV will revoke your installer authorisation and notify your Competent Person Scheme (CPS) operator if you, or one of your authorised installer representatives, does not comply with the scheme’s requirements. For example, if you:


  fail to inform the relevant DNO of a chargepoint installation
  fail to issue a BS7671 Electrical Installation Certificate

  install a chargepoint that is found to be unsafe
  complete an installation that does not meet the minimum technical standards required for the scheme
  do not conduct a site survey, or proceed with an installation when the survey identified that the existing supply or distribution equipment was not safe
  inflate costs to obtain a higher grant level
  cross-subsidise costs incurred in other parts of the business


If there is any evidence of fraudulent activity or misuse of government funding by any party under the WCS, OZEV reserves the right to take whatever action it deems appropriate, including, but not limited to:


  revising your grant level
  legal action to reclaim monies paid
  terminating the scheme
  revoking the authorisation of any installer or approval of any manufacturer under the scheme


Chargepoint audits

OZEV, or its representatives, will conduct on-site audits of installed chargepoints to ensure the requirements of the grant are met.

If a chargepoint is selected for audit, OZEV or its representatives will contact the relevant party for further information. Information requested may include all documentation pertaining to the installation, including:


  installation and commissioning confirmations and certificates
  business declarations, signatures and applicant details
  dates of installation
  any photographs taken at the time of installation demonstrating that the existing supply, distribution equipment, chargepoint cabling and installation meet OZEV requirements


OZEV will seek to provide feedback to installers on any of their installations audited.

How to change your authorised installer details

Adding sub-contractors once you have been authorised

You may decide in time that you wish to add a sub-contractor to your authorisation.

If the sub-contractors you wish to use are not already OZEV approved installers, you must email Installer.Authorisation@dvla.gov.uk to request permission to add the sub-contractors to your list.

To approve a sub-contractor, we need to see:


  the name and address of the sub-contractor
  their Competent Person scheme (CPS) name and their CPS membership number


Do not use sub-contractors to install any chargepoint units for your company until you have received approval from the Installer Authorisation team.

Updating your company details once you have been authorised

If any of your company details change from when you were authorised, you must send these changes to Installer.Authorisations@dvla.gov.uk immediately.

This is to ensure our installer authorisation list is up to date and that you receive all communications sent from OZEV.

Changing your company name

If you are changing your company name, email your new company details to Installer.Authorisations@dvla.gov.uk immediately. The authorisation team will carry out verification checks and will email you to confirm the changes have been made.

If you have created or set up a new company that has a different entity to the company you are currently authorised for, you must reapply to be an OZEV authorised installer.

You will be sent an Annex A form when you request a name change. Complete this form using your new company name.

Changing your bank details

If you change your bank details, email Installer.Authorisations@dvla.gov.uk immediately. Complete an Annex A form and provide your new bank details. The completed form will be sent to DFT finance so that your bank details can be updated on the system.

Please note that it can take up to 6 weeks for bank details to be updated.

Deactivating your OZEV account

If you wish to be removed from the OZEV scheme, email Installer.Authorisations@dvla.gov.uk as soon as possible. We will deactivate your account once all claims have been settled.
