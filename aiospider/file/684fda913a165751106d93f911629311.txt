About this list

This is a list of financial institutions approved by HMRC to manage ISAs. HMRC ISA manager approval is not an endorsement of a firm or its products.

HMRC does not approve ISA products offered by ISA managers and ISA eligibility of an investment does not guarantee returns or protect you from losses. As with any other investment your money could be at risk.

Before investing, you should make sure that you fully understand the investment risks and determine whether the investment is suitable for you and your circumstances. You should make sure that you fully understand the terms and conditions of your account. You may wish to take independent advice before making any decisions.

Some ISA investments might not be readily realisable (meaning it could take a while to access your money) and may not have protection from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

The address shown on this list is normally the manager’s registered office, but the day-to-day management of ISAs may be carried out elsewhere. ISA transfer requests sent to the address on this list may need to be redirected.

This list is updated on the first working day of each month.
