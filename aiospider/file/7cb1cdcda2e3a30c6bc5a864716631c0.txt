Ofsted inspects proposed free schools, studio schools and university technical colleges (UTCs) before their opening.

Following this type of inspection, Ofsted inspectors produce an advice note for the Secretary of State on the extent to which the proposed school is likely to meet the independent school standards at the time of opening.

This advice note informs the Secretary of State’s decision on whether a proposed free school, studio school or UTC should be registered. It is important to note that the decision is not made solely on the strength of the advice note but is also based on other information available to the Secretary of State.

The advice notes from the 2020 programme of pre-registration inspections are available on this page.
