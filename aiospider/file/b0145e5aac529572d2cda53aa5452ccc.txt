However, UK occupies the second position regarding total outbound spend only behind Germany. In terms of average trip expenditure for international trips, UK is not among the ‘big spenders’ and countries such as Finland, Germany and Switzerland are above UK.Inbound market trends are quite similar and don’t differ significantly from outbound market ones, with a 73% of drop in expenditures in total (combining business and leisure) and a recovery horizon of 2027 for business segment and 2024 for leisure.
