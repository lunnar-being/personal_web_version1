Most organizations have experimented with these technologies through pilots and “pathfinders”—successful initial experiments that illuminate the way for others to follow—to validate that the technology works and that it is able to deliver value in areas such as cost reductions, innovation, and improvements in citizen and employee experience, service levels and performance, and cycle time. While they have been successful in the “experimentation” phase, few government organizations have been successful in scaling modern technologies and implementing data, analytics, and digital practices in their day-to-day operations.
    
    
The government transition this fall is a good opportunity for public-sector leaders to think ahead, leveraging the next four years to accelerate and scale digital ambitions to deliver on agencies’ objectives. Scaling ensures that the entire organization reaps the benefits of digital, drives efficiencies and effectiveness in programs, and that key stakeholders and constituents experience improved satisfaction levels.Ten building blocks for successfully scaling digital
	
To scale technologies effectively, public-sector leaders can learn from their experiences in the experimentation phase and ensure the following ten building blocks are put in place:
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
While preparing for the next four years, public-sector leaders have the opportunity to consider deploying these ten building blocks to harness the full power of technology, data, and digital to improve their constituents’ experiences and build on their agencies’ achievements.
