Award Number: DE-EE0008944CX(s) Applied: A9Water Power Technologies OfficeLocation(s): NJOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Stevens Institute of Technology (SIT) to develop operational strategies for cascading hydroelectric systems (CHEs). SIT and its project partners would simulate various approaches for achieving operational flexibility in CHEs. Forecasting methodologies would also be developed to predict seasonal water inflows for the enhancement of operating efficiencies for CHE reservoirs.
