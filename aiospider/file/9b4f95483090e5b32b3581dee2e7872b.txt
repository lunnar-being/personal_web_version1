The Code of practice for scientific advisory committees (CoPSAC) covers all aspects of their governance. It provides guidance on the establishment, management and conduct of committees and sets out their relationship with the bodies they advise.

We revised and republished in 2021 following a public consultation.

              The advice on making public appointments to scientific advisory committees needs to be updated. Those making appointments should contact the Cabinet Office Public Appointments Policy Team (PAPT) for advice.
