Grid Fruit, LLC. - Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania $199,999$199,999June 29, 2020 â€“ June 28, 2021Grid Fruit will develop an integrated hardware and software technology, a non-invasive automation solution that improves both energy resilience and energy efficiency of centralized and single condensing commercial refrigeration systems. This project provides a lower-cost alternative to bolstering refrigeration resilience in comparison to storage-based alternatives. Additionally, the controller allows for the system to partake in providing grid services.Controlling operations with these optimized settings at the refrigeration case level will drop energy consumption in each food store by an estimated 174 MWh annually.Jesse Thornburg , Grid Fruit
