          Details


          

    
            
This is a competitive process which seeks to offer small grants up to a maximum of £10,000 for each award. The scheme is run to support the education and outreach aims and objectives of the UK Space Agency, as set out in its Education, Skills and Outreach Strategy.

This, in turn, will support the aims of the UK Space Agency by encouraging and supporting the use of space as an inspiring context for teaching and learning, by addressing the skills needs of the UK space sector and by improving awareness of the UK’s space programme and STEM literacy in general.

Please read the attached guidance and use the application form to apply for a grant. Do not forget to request interim payments if needed.

Where applicants are limited companies or registered charities, they will be required to include their company or charity numbers on the application form to enable due diligence checks.

Applicants who opt to work with project partners will be responsible for conducting assurance checks on those partners and will need to submit a partner assurance statement (for details please refer to the Grant Call Guidance).

Successful applicants will be offered a grant and the template, which can be found above, should be read carefully before applying. If applicants wish to propose minor changes to the wording they should do so before the close of the application window (doing so in no way affects the selection of successful applicants).

Successful projects should not be started before the grant agreement is signed. Applicants should aim to complete projects before 18 March 2022 and certainly by no later than 31 March 2022.

As this is an extremely popular and competitive scheme, often being oversubscribed, particular attention should be focused on best meeting the judging criteria outlined in the Grant Call Guidance when applying.

We anticipate the following schedule:


  
    opening of award scheme – 10 March 2021
  
  
    deadline for proposals to be received – 5pm 30 April 2021
  
  
    outcome notification – w/c 14 June 2021
  
  
    projects to start - no earlier than 21 June 2021
  
  
    projects to be completed - by 18 March 2022
