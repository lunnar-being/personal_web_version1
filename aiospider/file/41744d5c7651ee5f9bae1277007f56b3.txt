This guide is for British citizens travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa, work permit or residence permit.

Entry requirements

If you’re going to Belgium to work (or any other EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) you must make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements.

On the day you travel, you’ll need your passport to both:


  have at least 6 months left
  be less than 10 years old (even if it has 6 months or more left)


If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attend business meetings. These are usually covered by the Schengen visa waiver.

If you’re going for other types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.

The Belgian authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.


You must always check with the Belgium government before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements


You’ll need to check the specific rules of the region you’re going to:


  Flanders
  Wallonia
  Brussels


If you’re working in more than one country you will need to check the entry rules of each country.

If you need a passport, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.

Visa and permit documents

This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in Belgium. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.

It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with the Belgian immigration authorities or embassy.

You must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:


  translated
  
‘legalised’ (apostillised) or notarised
  originals, or if copies are acceptable
  signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)
  dated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application


Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa.

This guide uses the same terms used in Belgium, so you know which ones to use when speaking to the Belgian authorities.

Check if you need a visa or permit

You do not need a visa or permit if you’re travelling to Belgium for up to 90 days in a 180-day period for:


  running or attending job interviews
  attending trade fairs or seminar conventions
  board meetings
  meeting clients or customers
  meeting colleagues, contractors or sellers
  negotiating, signing and executing deals or contracts
  touring a company facility
  receiving goods supplied and manufactured by a Belgian company
  attending, speaking or presenting at a conference (paid or unpaid)
  team building activities
  leisure travel, such as holidays or visiting friends or family


Or for the following types of training, as long as it’s for the same company or group:


  receiving classroom-based training
  receiving on-the-job training
  shadowing someone’s job
  providing classroom-based or on-the-job training (Flanders only)


You also do not need a visa or permit if attending closed circle meetings for a maximum of 20 consecutive days at a time and 60 days a year. This includes customer negotiations, staff evaluations and company strategy meetings.

Check with the Belgian authorities if you’re not sure whether your meeting is a ‘closed circle meeting’.

These activities are covered by the Schengen visa waiver.

Border checks

At the border, you may be asked to show:


  proof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets
  health insurance that covers your stay
  proof of accommodation for your entire stay
  enough money for the duration of your trip
  an invitation letter from your employer explaining your trip


Check Belgium’s exemptions

Certain types of work and activities do not require a visa or permit because they’re exempt. 
All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.

Each region in Belgium may also have its own exemptions and are not all covered in this guide. You’ll need to check with the individual authorities for a full list:


  Flanders
  Wallonia
  Brussels


The following examples may be exempt in some regions but not in others so you would have to check:


  after-sales service work (urgent maintenance or repair) for up to 5 calendar days in a month
  installing software for up to 8 calendar days a month
  prototype testing for up to 4 weeks in a calendar year
  installing or assembling first or initial systems or products for up to 8 days (doesn’t apply to those in the construction industry)
  self-employed workers staying in Belgium for business purposes for up to 5 days a month
  athletes, referees, support staff, official representatives, staff members, and any others recognised by the international or national sporting federations, travelling to Belgium for an international sports competition – allowed only for the duration of the competition and for a maximum of 3 months in a calendar year
  artists with an international reputation performing in Flanders for up to 21 days a quarter (includes support staff)
  artists with an international reputation performing in Brussels for up to 90 days a quarter (includes support staff)
  international transport sector workers (transporting passengers or goods)
  staff at international institutions – only if the institution’s status is governed by a ratified international treaty
  public administration staff and diplomats


Your employer may need to submit a Limosa declaration to the Belgian authorities.

Show proof of exemption

You need to be able to show proof that you’re exempt to the authorities on request. This could be:


  an assignment letter
  employment confirmation
  a contract
  proof of required qualifications, such as a diploma and professional certificates
  CV


If you’re going for other business purposes or for more than 90 days, you may need a short or long-term permit.

Further checks

If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from the Belgian embassy.

Applying for a visa or permit

This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit. The application process and document requirements vary by region so they will have to tell you which ones you need.

Taking your family

For the short-term permits listed in this guide your family won’t be able to get dependant visas. They can join you for up to 90 days under the visa waiver rules.

There may be different rules for taking families if you have a long-stay permit.

Short and long-term permits
You need to apply for a short-term work permit if you’re in Belgium for up to 90 days in a 180-day period because you’re:


  transferring short term to a Belgian branch of a UK-based company
  providing short-term services to a client in Belgium


You need to apply for a long-term permit if you’re in Belgium for more than 90 days because you’re:


  transferring long term to the Belgian branch of a UK-based company
  working for a Belgian company on a long-term Belgian employment contract
  providing long-term services to a client in Belgium
  carrying out self-employed work
  conducting research work


Long-term permits are valid for up to 5 years depending on which one you need.

You need a short-term work permit to provide support that requires specialised technical knowledge (such as installing, repairing and maintaining machinery) if your UK employer has a contract or work order with a Belgian company.

Some of these activities do not require a permit if they’re only for a few days. Having this permit would allow you to carry out the work for a longer period of time.

  have relevant professional experience
  keep your UK employment contract
  stay on UK payroll
