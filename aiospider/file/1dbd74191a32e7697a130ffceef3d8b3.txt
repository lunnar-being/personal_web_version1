      2
      The equipment is supplied to, or for donation to, a charity that provides rescue or first aid services
    
    
      3
      The equipment is to be used by the charity solely for providing rescue or first aid services
    
  


Rescue equipment that is eligible for zero rating includes:


  
    image intensifiers, heat seekers and similar specialist equipment used to locate casualties
  
  
    flares used to illuminate large areas for search purposes
  
  
    two-way radios that are pre-calibrated to the emergency frequency
  


General use items such as mobile phones and pagers, binoculars, torches, searchlights and loudhailers are not zero-rated, even when they’re purchased for use by a rescue or first aid charity.

4.9 Resuscitation training models that can be zero-rated

Resuscitation training models (resuscitation dummies) can only be zero-rated if they include a head and torso designed for use during first aid training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation techniques.

4.10 Repair, maintenance or installation of eligible goods

The repair or maintenance of any goods detailed in paragraph 4.1, and any goods supplied in connection with this repair and maintenance, are zero-rated when the:


  
    goods are owned or possessed by an eligible body
  
  
    repair or maintenance service is paid for using charitable or donated funds
  


Zero rating also applies to any goods supplied in connection with a zero-rated supply of repair and maintenance.

If the normal selling price of relevant goods includes an amount for installation, fixing or connection to mains services or testing equipment on site, zero rating applies to the whole selling price – including that element which relates to installation or testing.

Where building works, such as removal of walls or reinforcing floors, are necessary in order to install large items of equipment, these works are standard-rated, even when carried out by the supplier of the equipment.

4.11 Examples of qualifying goods or services

When consulting this table, you should remember that in addition to the supply being of qualifying goods or services, all of the other conditions detailed in paragraph 2.1 must be met for zero rating to apply.

This list is not exhaustive. With the pace of technological change, new types of equipment will often be developed. If an item does not appear on this list, the underlying principles set out in this notice should be followed to determine if the item is a qualifying one. In areas of doubt, specialist advice should be sought.

5. Funding and purchasing

5.1 How the purchase should be funded

For zero rating to apply, it’s essential that all funds to pay for the qualifying relevant goods or services be:


  
    charitable
  
  
    from voluntary donations or contributions
  


Alternatively, relevant goods or services (except computer software), purchased by a third party for donation to certain eligible bodies can be zero-rated – see paragraph 6.1.

If a charity buys goods with its own funds, the purchase is made with charitable funds.

Where a person, group or organisation contributes funds to an eligible body, and do not receive anything in return, this is a voluntary contribution or donation. Lottery funding is also regarded as a voluntary contribution for the purposes of this relief.

If an eligible body that is not a charity contributes to the purchase from its own resources, the goods or services cannot be zero-rated, even if the supply is of qualifying goods or services.

National Health Service funds are not charitable or donated, and any goods or services purchased with these funds are not zero-rated.

6. Purchasing goods and services for donation to an eligible body

6.1 General

Qualifying goods and services can be zero-rated when they’re supplied to any person, body or organisation for donation to:


  
    one of the health bodies specified in paragraph 3.2
  
  
    a hospital or research institution, whose activities are carried out on a not-for-profit basis – see paragraph 3.3
  
  
    one of the charitable institutions specified in paragraph 3.4.1
  


Brief details of the donor, and the eligible body to which the goods or services will be donated, should be given on any declaration of eligibility for zero rating provided by the purchaser to the supplier – see paragraph 8.2.

Items purchased for donation to any other charity may not be zero-rated under this relief, even if the charity is an eligible body that would benefit from relief if it purchased the goods or services itself.

When a charity sells, lets or exports goods that have been donated for that purpose, this onward supply of the goods by the charity can be zero-rated. For further details see Imports (VAT Notice 702).

7. Imports and exports

7.1 Goods purchased from outside the UK

VAT relief also applies when goods are imported from outside the UK. This means that where all the conditions in paragraph 2.1 are met, no VAT will be charged on the importation of qualifying goods. In order for relief to apply, importers should lodge the relevant declaration of eligibility (see paragraph 8.2) with us at the point of importation.

If you import computer software you should also read Imports (VAT Notice 702) and Place of supply of services (VAT Notice 741A).

7.2 Bringing goods into Northern Ireland from an EU member state

If you’re registered for VAT in Northern Ireland and you purchase goods from a business registered for VAT in an EU member state, you must normally account for VAT in the UK on your acquisition of the goods. The rate of tax due is the one applicable to the supply of identical goods in the UK. This means that no VAT is due on the acquisition of qualifying goods purchased by eligible bodies using charitable or donated funds. Eligible bodies acquiring relevant goods from an EU member state are not required to provide their supplier with an eligibility declaration, but should retain evidence that the goods were eligible for acquisition at the zero rate of VAT.

The single market (VAT Notice 725) explains the VAT rules that apply to goods acquired from member states of the EU.

If you’re in Northern Ireland but not registered for VAT and you purchase goods from an EU member state, the goods will be liable to VAT according to the rules of the member state in which the supply takes place. This supply will be taxed at the rate in force in that country, and zero rating will not apply.

7.3 Goods sold to eligible bodies based outside the UK

It is not a requirement of this relief that an eligible body is based in the UK, although relief will not apply to any supply made to health boards in other countries. Therefore, the relief outlined in this notice will apply where the conditions detailed in paragraph 2.1 are met in full.

Exports of goods to countries outside the UK are zero-rated under the normal export rules.

Goods exported from the UK (VAT Notice 703) explains the rules relating to goods that are exported from the UK.

8. Evidence of eligibility for relief

8.1 Determining if your supply is zero-rated

You should be able to determine whether the goods or services you’re supplying are qualifying goods and services (see paragraph 4.1). But, before you zero rate your supply, you must be satisfied that:


  
    the purchaser is an eligible body (see paragraph 3.1), or is purchasing the goods or services for donation to an eligible body – see paragraph 6.1
  
  
    the goods or services are being purchased with charitable or donated funds – see paragraph 5.1
  
  
    where appropriate, the goods or services are being purchased for a qualifying use – see paragraphs 3.4.1 and 4.3
  


You may wish to consult the checklist at section 9 before zero rating your supply.

8.2 Demonstrating eligibility for relief

8.2.1 The evidence of eligibility a supplier should obtain from the purchaser

The supplier is responsible for ensuring that all the conditions for zero rating are met. We recommend that suppliers obtain a written declaration of eligibility from each customer who claims entitlement to VAT relief. Such a declaration should contain sufficient information to demonstrate that the conditions for the relief are fulfilled. The declaration should be separate, or clearly distinguishable from, any order form or invoice against which the goods or services are supplied. A customer signing an order should not automatically be signing a declaration of eligibility for VAT relief.

The supplement to this notice contains examples of acceptable formats for declarations. These examples may be copied or otherwise reproduced by suppliers or purchasers. Any other declaration form used must require the purchaser to provide the same information as the relevant example shown in the supplement to this notice.

In addition to a written declaration, suppliers may require evidence that the purchaser is an eligible body. This may include in the case of:


  
    any charitable body, evidence this it is a charity – How VAT affects charities (VAT Notice 701/1) provides further details on which bodies are charities
  
  
    domiciliary care agencies, day centres or other establishments, evidence that care or treatment services are provided mainly to chronically sick or disabled people – see paragraph 8.2.2
  
  
    charitable transport providers, evidence that transport services are provided mainly to disabled people – see paragraph 8.2.3
  
  
    other charities, evidence that its sole purpose is the provision of services for, or on behalf of, chronically sick or disabled people – see paragraph 8.2.4
  


Suppliers must retain evidence that any supply they have zero-rated was eligible for relief. This may include an eligibility declaration, and any accompanying documents provided by the purchaser.

8.2.2 Demonstrating that care or treatment services are provided, in the majority of cases, to chronically sick or disabled people

To be an eligible body, a charitable day centre or care establishment should be able to demonstrate that over an extended period of time, 51% or more of the recipients of care or treatment services are chronically sick or disabled people. This should be evident from the care provider’s own records, including publicity materials and details of the charity’s day-to-day operations.

8.2.3 Demonstrating that transport services are provided mainly to chronically sick or disabled people

To be an eligible body, a charitable transport provider should be able to demonstrate that its transport services are provided predominantly to chronically sick or disabled people – see paragraph 3.4.3. It is not necessary for transport providers to maintain detailed records of all passengers transported, but the fact that its services are provided predominantly to chronically sick or disabled people should be reflected in its constitution or aims and objectives, or in other materials such as:


  
    publicity and advertising material
  
  
    any documents issued for the purpose of obtaining funding from a third party, such as a local authority
  
  
    evidence of day-to-day operations
  
  
    any other evidence that may be relevant, for example, an analysis of passengers carried over a representative period
  


For the charitable transport provider to be an eligible body, the evidence should all show a consistent theme, that transport services are focused towards one client group, chronically sick or disabled people, and are provided predominantly (but not necessarily exclusively) for the needs of these clients.

8.2.4 Demonstrating that the sole purpose and function of a charity is to provide services for, or on behalf of, chronically sick or disabled people

The charity’s purpose and function may be clear from its constitution and aims and objectives, but may also be reflected in its publicity material; applications for funding, and details of its day-to-day operations.

8.3 Responsibility for applying the correct rate of VAT

The supplier is responsible for ensuring that all the conditions for zero rating are met.

The production of a declaration or any other evidence of eligibility by a customer does not authorise the zero rating of a supply. A supplier must take reasonable steps to check any apparent inconsistencies, and to confirm that any information given by the purchaser is correct.

But, the purchaser has a responsibility to make a truthful statement of its eligibility for zero rating, and, where required, to provide appropriate documentation to support this statement.

8.4 If suppliers get it wrong

Extra Statutory Concession 3.11, which is set out in Notice 48 Extra-statutory concessions provides that customs will not seek to recover tax due from a supplier who has taken reasonable steps to check the validity of a declaration, but has failed to identify an inaccuracy, and, in good faith, has zero-rated a supply. This concession will only be applied if the supplier can demonstrate that all reasonable steps were taken to check the details provided on the declaration.
