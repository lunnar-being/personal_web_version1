This guide is for British citizens travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa or permit.

Entry requirements

If you’re going to Portugal to work (or any other EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) you must make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements.

On the day you travel, you’ll need your passport to both:


  have at least 6 months left
  be less than 10 years old (even if it has 6 months or more left)


If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attend business meetings. These are usually covered by the Schengen visa waiver.

If you’re going for other types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.

Portugal’s authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.


You must always check with Portugal’s government before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements.


If you’re working in more than one country you’ll need to check the entry rules of each country.

If you need a passport, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.

Visa and permit documents

This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in Portugal. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.

It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with Portugal’s immigration authorities or embassy in the UK.

You must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:


  translated
  
‘legalised’ (apostillised) or notarised
  originals, or if copies are acceptable
  signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)
  dated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application


Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa.

This guide uses the same terms used in Portugal, so you know which ones to use when speaking to Portugal’s authorities.

Check if you need a visa or permit

You don’t need a visa or permit if you’re travelling to Portugal for up to 90 days in a 180-day period for:


  attending business and sales meetings
  running or attending job interviews
  buying goods for sale outside the country
  attending a trade show, seminar or convention
  searching for new suppliers
  negotiating and signing contracts
  touring a company facility
  team building activities
  attending court as a witness


These activities are covered by the Schengen visa waiver.

Border checks

At the border, you may be asked to show:


  proof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets
  health insurance that covers your entire stay
  proof of accommodation for your entire stay
  enough money for the duration of your trip
  an invitation letter that explains your trip


Check Portugal’s exemptions

Certain types of work and activities do not require a visa or permit because they’re exempt.

All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.

Portugal does not have any exemptions. However, if you have an EU intra-company transfer permit (EU ICT) from another country you can work for up to 90 days in a 180-day period. You will not need a Portuguese visa or permit.

You have to notify Portugal’s immigration office (Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras) within 3 business days of arriving if you’re coming from an EU country. You need to make a telephone appointment to do this.

Show proof of exemption

You need to be able to show your EU ICT permit to the authorities to prove that you’re exempt.

Further checks

If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from the Portuguese  immigration authorities or embassy in the UK.

Applying for a visa or permit

This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit to help you prepare, but you’ll need to check the exact rules and processes with Portugal’s immigration authorities or embassy in the UK.

Taking your family

Your family won’t be able to apply for dependant permits for short trips. They may be able to visit you under the Schengen visa waiver.

Families will be able to join you with the longer-term residence permits listed in this guide.

Short and long-term visas and permits

You need a temporary stay visa if you’re in Portugal because you’re:


  transferring short term from a UK-based company to a branch in Portugal
  working for a Portuguese company on a short fixed-term Portuguese contract

  seasonal work
  independent work
  highly qualified activity
  professional activity
  amateur sports activity
  show business and performing artists
  religious training within a religious congregation
  religious person undertaking studies in a recognised institution


You need to apply for a longer-term residence permit if you’re in Portugal because you’re:


  transferring long term to the Portuguese branch of a UK-based company
