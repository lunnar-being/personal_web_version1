The UK government has opened the Generic Design Assessment (GDA) to Advanced Nuclear Technologies.

GDA allows the UK’s independent nuclear regulators to assess the safety, security, and environmental implications of new reactor designs and to provide the confidence that these new designs are capable of meeting the UK’s statutory regulatory requirements.

This guidance is for anyone submitting a nuclear power plant design for GDA (a Requesting Party). It tells you the information required by the government and the regulators to assess a Requesting Party’s readiness to enter the GDA.

The entry process is an open and ongoing process. Requesting Parties are invited to apply when they assess themselves ready for GDA. The government welcomes applications from all Advanced Nuclear Technology providers seeking to progress advanced nuclear projects in the UK.
