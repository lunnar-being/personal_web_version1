The document has been produced at the request of representatives of a range of international non-governmental organisations (NGOs), led by Oxfam. It addresses their concerns about the risk of prosecution associated with working in areas where terrorist groups operate and reputational damage if their assets are diverted for the purpose of terrorism.

This document directs users to the guidance that is available on this topic and answers some of the most common questions.

The NGOs were consulted on the content and changes made in response to their comments.
