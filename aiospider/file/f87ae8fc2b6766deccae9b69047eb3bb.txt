          Details


          

    
            
This guidance details the legal responsibilities for those who suspend (fixed period exclusion) and permanently exclude pupils from educational settings, including:


  headteachers
  local authorities
  governing bodies
  academy trusts
  independent review panel members
  independent review panel clerks
  special educational needs experts


It governs the exclusion of pupils from:


  local-authority-maintained schools
  academies and free schools
  pupil referral units


The additional guidance on changes to the school exclusion process during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak should be used alongside the main guidance.

Statutory guidance sets out what schools and local authorities must do to comply with the law. You should follow the guidance unless you have a very good reason not to.

It would be helpful to read this guidance alongside:


  School Discipline (Pupil Exclusions and Reviews) (England) Regulations 2012
  The Education (Provision of Full-Time Education for Excluded Pupils) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2014
  The School Discipline (England) (Coronavirus) (Pupil Exclusions and Reviews) (Amendment) Regulations 2020
