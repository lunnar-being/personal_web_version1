On April 20–21, 2021, the U.S. Department of Energy's Bioenergy Technologies Office will host a virtual workshop titled, , covering the topic of algae crop protection to facilitate scaling of the algae industry. A major barrier to the scaling and intensification of algal cultivation is the partial or complete loss of productivity due to pests, just like traditional farming. Developing effective strategies to maintain harvest yield over time is essential to meeting BETO’s long-term goals of promoting cost competitive biofuels and bioproducts.Download the agenda for this workshop below.
