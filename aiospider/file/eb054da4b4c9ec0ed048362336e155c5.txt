Award Number: DE-EE0009240CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Fuel Cell Technologies OfficeLocation(s): NEOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Hexagon R&D, LLC (Hexagon) to develop processes for carbon fiber synthesis for use in hydrogen storage applications. Research would focus on targeted developments in material synthesis, processing, and hydrogen storage vessel design. Carbon fiber produced via the optimized processes would be used to fabricate and test hydrogen storage vessels. The project would be completed over five Budget Periods (BPs).
