The Commonwealth Marine Economies (CME) Programme aims to support sustainable marine economies that:


  create jobs
  drive national economic growth
  reduce poverty
  ensure food security
  build resilience against forces of nature


The UK government funds this programme and delivers it in partnership with world-leading marine organisations from the UK. It aims to ensure marine resources in Commonwealth Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are better understood and managed.
