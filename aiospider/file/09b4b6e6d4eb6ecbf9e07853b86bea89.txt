          Details


          

    
            
The UK faces a real threat from terrorism and crowded places remain an attractive target.

Crowded places include shopping centres, sports stadia, bars, pubs and clubs which are easily accessible to the public and attractive to terrorists.

This guidance has been written to help those charged with security at crowded places mitigate the threat and help make the UK less vulnerable to an attack.

For site specific advice relating to your premises, contact your CTSA or use the non-emergency police telephone number 101.
