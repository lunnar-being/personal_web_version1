Altex Technologies Corp. - San Jose, California $199,920$199,920June 29, 2020 – March 28, 2020This project will develop a natural gas driven cogeneration system that has the potential to provide resiliency to electrical outages and have a payback on the order of 3-5 years. The project team is designing a tri-generation system driven off of a boiler burner that allows for high value electricity to be generated and cooling to be produced while using the boiler’s heat exchangers to capture the exhaust heat. This removes the need for recuperators typically found on microturbine generation systems.This project will make building power, heating and cooling functions completely resilient to grid power disruptions while reducing fuel use and fuel cost.
