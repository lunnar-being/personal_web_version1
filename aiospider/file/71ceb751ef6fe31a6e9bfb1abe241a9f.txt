          Details


          

    
            
The ‘Ten point plan for a green industrial revolution’ sets out an ambition to deploy CCUS at scale in 2 of the UK’s industrial clusters by the mid-2020s, and a further 2 by 2030.

Phase-1 of the cluster sequencing process will identify and sequence CCUS clusters which are suited to deployment in the mid-2020s. These clusters will have the first opportunity to negotiate for support from the government’s CCUS programme.

Phase-1 is open to cluster organisations which:


  are located in the UK
  are capable of deploying by 2030
  meet the definition of a CCUS cluster (see the guidance for more information)


How to apply


The deadline for expressions of interest was 21 May 2021.


Guidance on the submission process beyond this point is included in the guidance document.

Help and guidance

For full background and guidance on entering the process, please refer to the documents above.

Any queries and requests for accessible versions of the forms should be directed to clustersequencing@beis.gov.uk.
