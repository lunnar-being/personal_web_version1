          Details


          

    
            
We spend around £1.2 billion per annum of our budget directly with our supply chain. The most effective way for us to manage this spend is by letting larger contracts and frameworks.

Our Tier 2 suppliers are those companies who have successfully won larger contracts and in turn build their own supply chain to help deliver our mission.

Our key Tier 2 suppliers can be found here with relevant contact details and guidance about how to become part of their supply chain.
