The above guidance sets out:


  how local authorities can access the top-up financial support we have put in place during the 2021 Spring term, up to a capped level of 85% of January 2020 attendance levels; and
  how local authorities will be funded for the early years entitlements in the financial year 2021 to 2022


We have also published the 85% value of January 2020 attendance data for each relevant early years entitlement line for each local authority to help assess whether they will be eligible for the top-up funding for the spring term.
