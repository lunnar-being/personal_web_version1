The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program  the . Letters of intent (LOIs) are due on Monday, January 4, 2021.As part of this release,  under three topic areas that aim to develop innovative, cost-effective, energy-saving technologies that could lead to significant reductions in building energy consumption and enable interactions between buildings and the power grid. includes the following five subtopics, which aim to achieve these advances:BTO is also seeking proposals through a joint topic with the Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) called Advanced Building Construction Technologies (Topic 13). This topic supports DOEâ€™s Advanced Building Construction (ABC) initiative, the objective of which is to help realize the vision of a modernized U.S. construction industry that delivers high-performance, low-carbon new buildings and retrofits at scale. ABC approaches are intended to result in residential and commercial buildings that have ultra-efficient energy performance, fast on-site construction, and renovation timelines, and are affordable and provide additional value to owners and tenants through improved aesthetics, comfort, resilience, and occupant health. includes the following four subtopics, which aim to achieve these advances:Finally, BTO is also soliciting proposals as part of a joint effort in topic 20: CABLE Materials and Applications. The objectives of the Conductivity-enhanced materials for Affordable, Breakthrough Leapfrog Electric and Thermal Applications (CABLE): Materials and Applications topic are 1) to transfer technology for the fabrication of breakthrough CABLE enhanced conductivity materials and 2) to support leapfrog applications in the design and use of enhanced conductivity materials that will make performance improvements and energy savings more affordable.includes the following three BTO subtopics (c, d, and e), which aim to achieve these advances:Visit  to apply today!
