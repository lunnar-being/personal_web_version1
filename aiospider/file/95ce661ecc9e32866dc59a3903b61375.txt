Award Number: DE-EE0009242CX(s) Applied: A9, B1.31, B3.6Fuel Cell Technologies OfficeLocation(s): TNOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to Collaborative Composites Solutions Corporation (CCSC) to develop and demonstrate melt spinning of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) precursor to reduce costs of high strength carbon fibers for use in hydrogen storage vessels. Project activities include precursor formulation development, design and build of customized equipment for precursor spinning, process optimization, precursor conversion trials, techno-economic modeling, scale-up of precursor and carbon fiber production, manufacturing and testing of high-pressure tanks, end-of-life recycling assessment, and final reporting.
