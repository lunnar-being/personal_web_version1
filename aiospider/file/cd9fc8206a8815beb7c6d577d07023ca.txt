          Details


          

    
            
Phase 1 of the Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme provides £1 billion in grants as part of the Chancellor’s ‘Plan for Jobs 2020’ commitment to support the UK’s economic recovery from COVID-19, supporting up to 30,000 jobs in the low carbon and energy efficiency sectors.

Phase 1 will reduce non-traded carbon emissions from the public sector by up to 0.1 MtCO2e/year and up to 0.5 MtCO2e over each of Carbon Budgets 4 and 5. This is equivalent to taking around 45,000 cars off the road.

Phase 1 closed to new applications on 11 January 2021. The scheme is providing funding over the financial years 2020/2021 and 2021/2022.

For more information about Phase 1, please see the Salix Finance website.
