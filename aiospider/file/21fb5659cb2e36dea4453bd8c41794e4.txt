– The Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) has selected nine new Predictive Science Academic Alliance Program (PSAAP) III Centers to support science-based modeling and simulation and exascale computing technologies.The PSAAP integrates modeling, simulation, and experiment in a manner that contributes to the nuclear security mission and prepares the next generation of scientists and engineers for careers in national security.PSAAP III Centers will be funded by NNSA’s Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) program, which directs research and development activities to maintain the safety, security, and effectiveness of the Nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile.“The stockpile stewardship mission is founded on a scientifically credible modeling and simulation capability underwritten by experiment,” said Dr. Mark Anderson, Assistant Deputy Administrator for Research, Development, Test and Evaluation in NNSA’s Office of Defense Programs. “The PSAAP integrates modeling, simulation, and experiment in a manner that contributes to the nuclear security mission and prepares the next generation of scientists and engineers for careers in national security.”Nine universities were selected either as a Multidisciplinary Simulation Center (MSC), a Single-Discipline Center (SDC), or a Focused Investigatory Center (FIC). Each MSC will receive up to $16.5 million, each SDC up to $9.5 million, and each FIC up to $5 million total over the course of five years under NNSA’s PSAAP III cooperative agreements. The following universities were awarded cooperative agreements:The ASC Academic Alliance Program was formed in 1997 to engage the U.S. academic community in advancing science-based modeling and simulation technologies. In 2008, the next phase of the Academic Alliance Program, PSAAP I continued with added emphasis on validation, verification, and uncertainty quantification. The program continued in 2014 with the establishment of PSAAP II Centers that provided additional focus on extreme-scale computing. These Centers will successfully conclude by end of fiscal year 2020.PSAAP is managed by the NNSA Office of Advanced Simulation and Computing in collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories..
