Award Number: DE-EE0008845CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Fuel Cell Technologies OfficeLocation(s): CAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to C-Zero to research and develop a process for the synthesis of hydrogen through molten salt based methane pyrolysis. C-Zero would investigate the properties of carbon formed in molten salts and characterize the hydrogen produced from the process. Prototype continuous carbon removal systems would be fabricated and tested as part of the project. The project would be completed over two Budget Periods (BPs), with a Go/No-Go Decision Point in between each BP.
