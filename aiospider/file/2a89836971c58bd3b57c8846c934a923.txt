We’ve long known that the key to driving  is to place an equal emphasis on how the organization makes money (performance)  how leaders run the place (health). Companies that do so outperform their peers . More recently, we’ve found that leaders can capture even more value when they go one step further and focus on performance and health at both the  levels.Driving performance and health across levels is a tall order, even for the most experienced leader. Doing this well requires embedding this new way of operating across all layers of the organization. This can be done by  to focus on helping employees develop knowledge, skills, and behaviors in four key areas (see exhibit).

By building individual capabilities across four quadrants and at scale, leaders have the potential to capture value and drive impact at levels previously thought unimaginable.
