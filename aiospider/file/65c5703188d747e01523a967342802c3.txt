          Details


          

    
            
These documents set out non-statutory guidance  for the trustees of occupational pension schemes on assessing, managing and reporting climate-related risks in line with the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). It was produced by the cross-government and Industry group: the Pensions Climate Risk Industry Group (PCRIG).

The guidance consists of 4 parts:


  Part 1 ‘Introduction’ introduces climate risk as a financial risk to pension schemes, trustees’ legal requirements and the TCFD recommendations
  Part 2 ‘Trustee governance, strategy and risk management: how to integrate and disclose climate-related risks’ sets out a suggested approach for the integration and disclosure of climate risk within the typical governance and decision-making processes of pension trustee boards, including defining investment beliefs, setting investment strategy, manager selection, and monitoring
  Part 3 ‘Scenario analysis’ contains technical details on recommended scenario analysis
  Part 4 ‘Setting metrics and targets to measure and manage climate-related risk’ recommends metrics that trustees may wish to consider using to record and report their findings


Both full length and summary ‘quick start guide’ versions of each part have been produced.
