          Details


          

    
            
EEE covered by the WEEE regulations is known as ‘in scope’.

Use this guidance to check if the product:


  falls under the definition of EEE

  is in one of the categories
  is exempt or excluded


It also explains if you need to report the whole weight of the product or if there are elements of it you can deduct.

              We have added 'If you have an item that you need help to categorise, please contact your compliance scheme or regulator for help.' We have included clearer definitions of furniture that needs electricity to work properly and fridges using ammonia. We have added new items to category 1 (stairlifts), category 3 (cards with chips, and USB memory sticks and drives), category 9 (electric vehicle charging points with monitoring or other smart features) and category 10 (electric vehicle charge points with basic charging function only). We have also added items to the list of non- EEE product examples.
