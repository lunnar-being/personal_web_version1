College Accounts Direction for the year 2020 to 2021

The College Accounts Direction for the year 2020 to 2021 sets out ESFA’s financial reporting requirements for sixth-form and further education colleges.

The accounts direction outlines the requirements for each college to:


  prepare audited accounts to 31 July 2021
  submit accounts and associated documents to ESFA by 31 December 2021
  publish accounts on the college’s website as soon as possible after signing


Colleges must refer to the College Accounts Direction 2020 to 2021 when preparing their accounts.

In July 2021 ESFA published a supplementary bulletin relating to matters arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, to be read in conjunction with the College Accounts Direction for the year 2020 to 2021.

If colleges have concerns about meeting the 31 December submission deadline they should contact their ESFA territorial contact as soon as possible and prior to the submission deadline.

Colleges, rather than their auditors, will need to submit all required documents by following the submission process below.

Finance Record for the year 2020 to 2021

ESFA has issued an updated Finance Record for colleges to submit with their audited annual report and accounts for the college financial year 2020 to 2021.

Colleges should refer to the College Financial Planning Handbook to provide guidance on how to complete this return.

Submitting your documents

The above documents should be submitted to the ESFA via the College financial data submissions portal.

Once a college has logged in they will be able to upload their documents by selecting the tile for ‘Annual financial statements return’. The four mandatory elements (audited financial statements, auditor’s management letter, finance record and the audit committee annual report) must initially be uploaded at the same time by colleges but can subsequently be resubmitted separately, if required. There are also options to upload subsidiary financial statements and additional supporting documentation if applicable. Colleges will receive email confirmation that their upload has been successful.

Further details are available within the submission portal. If the person responsible for submitting these documents does not have access to the IDAMS system they can request an account using the ‘I don’t have an account’ link on the login page.

Please complete ESFA’s online enquiry form if you have any questions about your submission.
