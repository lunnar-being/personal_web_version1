This Home Office guide on firearms licensing law has been updated. It should be read alongside the statutory guidance for chief officers of police.

The document provides guidance on firearms licensing legislation for anyone who is involved in licensing firearms or who has an interest in firearms or shotguns for either work or leisure purposes.

This guide is not intended to be a definitive statement of the law, but a cohesive explanation of the often complex area of firearms licensing.
