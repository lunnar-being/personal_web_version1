          Details


          

    
            
This licence allows you to survey hazel dormice by hand, including handling them in:


  nests
  nest tubes
  nest boxes


You must release the dormice where they were captured as soon as you’ve examined them.

You need a level 2 licence to mark dormice by clipping their fur.

You must apply for an individual licence for survey, research or conservation work not covered by this licence, or a level 2 licence.

For development work affecting hazel dormice, you must apply for a mitigation licence.

Register with Natural England

Before you can use this licence, you must register with Natural England using the application form linked on this page.

When you need to pay
It costs £80 to register for a new CL10a licence.

From January 2022, it will cost £35 to renew your registration.

You must declare the intended use of the licence on your registration form. This will determine if you need to pay, such as to survey hazel dormice for development projects.

Natural England will refund unsuccessful applications.

Read the terms and conditions for paying for a wildlife licence.

When you do not need to pay

You do not need to pay if the licence is used for:


  voluntary purposes - any work you do is unpaid and you are registered with an organisation or charity as a volunteer
  conservation, science or research purposes - research related to the protected species is carried out by a student or employee of an academic institution or research body


How to pay

You can pay using a bank card. Follow the GOV.UK Pay link on the application form.

References

You need to complete a reference to support a survey or research licence form when you register for this licence if you:


  have not held a licence for the species or a similar species for the last 3 years
  have a licence but want to add new methods


Report action taken

To maintain your registration, you must report your actions on report form LR-CL10a-10b, even if you took no action. Return to Natural England using the details on the form by 31 January each year.
You must also submit your hazel dormice survey data following the guidance in Annex A of class licence CL10b.
