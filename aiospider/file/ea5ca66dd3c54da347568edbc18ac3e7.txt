Science is an edifice that is never finished. It is expanded, remodeled and strengthened continually by the efforts of a global community of scientists numbering in the many millions.New gaps and uncertainties become evident even as old ones are filled and narrowed. And, sometimes, long-established understandings are overturned by unexpected new discoveries. Einstein's relativity and Wegener's continental drift are famous examples.Skepticism about scientific claims — challenging them, testing them, testing them again when better tools become available — is a feature of the scientific process, not a bug. Accordingly, science should never be said to be completely "settled."At the same time, respect for healthy skepticism must be tempered by recognition that revolutions overturning central aspects of previous scientific understandings are extremely rare. The likelihood that the current, central understandings in any given scientific domain will be overturned declines with the diversity and robustness of the evidence supporting those understandings, including especially the extent of critical scrutiny, testing and retesting the supporting evidence has already received....
