In November 2018 the government launched a new framework to encourage businesses to report how many of their staff have a disability or health condition, and also to report on the health and wellbeing of staff. The framework is voluntary, and was created in partnership with employers and charities.

The Civil Service as a whole currently reports against the framework in full - this report provides the Home Officeâ€™s latest report in accordance with the guidance for voluntary reporting.
