"To tackle the climate emergency, we need to invest in the next generation of breakthrough technologies. Quantum information science plan an important role in cutting-edge energy research and focus on ways to address pressing energy challenges. This funding will provide resources for critical fusion energy and plasma-related projects including quantum information field research at the University of Maryland. I'm proud to support this innovative work being done by our scientists and I will continue working in Congress to ensure they have the resources they need to keep America competitive,"
