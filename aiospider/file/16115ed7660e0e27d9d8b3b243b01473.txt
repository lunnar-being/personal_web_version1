The countervailing duty on organic coated steel products from China was imposed by the EU on behalf of the UK and the other member states. The Secretary of State for International Trade transitioned the countervailing duty to continue applying in the UK after the transition period.

A transition review of the countervailing duty will be initiated before 4 May 2024.
