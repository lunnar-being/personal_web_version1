This guidance was most recently updated in April 2021.


Under the Right to Buy scheme, you can buy your home at a price lower than the full market value. This is because the length of time you have spent as a tenant entitles you to a discount.

This booklet describes the Right to Buy scheme as it works today, taking into account the changes made to the Right to Buy legislation which came into effect in April 2012 and July 2014. The information in it applies only to England. We have tried to make it easy to understand - but it is not a substitute for professional advice.
