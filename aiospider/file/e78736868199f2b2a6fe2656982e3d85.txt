It is also a key way to engage with ocean stakeholders broadly.





The OPC will coordinate across the federal government and drive forward effective ocean science and management policy.  The ocean plays an integral part in the Biden-Harris Administration’s key priorities including tackling climate change, racial equity, and the economy.





OPC members discussed three strategic priorities today:





Maximize the environmental, economic, and social benefits the ocean provides to Americans
Develop an ocean-climate action plan to focus agency actions on ocean-based mitigation of climate change effects
Identify strategic direction for ocean science and technology
