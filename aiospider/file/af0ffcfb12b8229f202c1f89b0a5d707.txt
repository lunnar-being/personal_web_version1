Award Number: DE-EE0009369CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): GAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) to develop a novel technique for the synthesis of thin film layers for perovskite solar cell applications. Metal oxide clusters would be incorporated into thin films through a vapor phase infiltration (VPI) process to inhibit crystallization and prevent moisture degradation.
