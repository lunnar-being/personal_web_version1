This page explains what face coverings are, their role in reducing the transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19), the settings in which they are recommended and how they should be safely used and stored. This information is based on current scientific evidence and is subject to change.

Exemption cards or badges

Some people may feel more comfortable showing something that says they do not have to wear a face covering. This could be in the form of an exemption card, badge or even a home-made sign.

This is a personal choice and is not necessary in law.

If you would like to use an exemption card you can use the PDF attachments on this page.

Those who have an age, health or disability reason not to wear a face covering should not be routinely asked to provide any written evidence of this. Written evidence includes exemption cards.
