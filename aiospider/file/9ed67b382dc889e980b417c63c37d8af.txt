Award Number: DE-EE0008841CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6, B3.15Fuel Cell Technologies OfficeLocation(s): OROffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to the University of Oregon (UO) to advance the understanding of, and develop mitigation strategies for, the negative effects of using low-purity feed water in membrane electrolyzers by controlling the flow of ions in the membranes and incorporating selective and impurity-tolerant electrocatalysts. Project work would occur within UO laboratory facilities in Eugene, OR. Additionally, collaboration is expected to occur with multiple laboratories within the HydroGEN Energy Materials Network Consortium.
