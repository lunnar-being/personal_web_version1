This common glossary brings together the defined terms used in the suite of functional standards, and notes which function owns each definition.

Use this glossary when describing functional work. This brings consistency in the vocabulary used across organisations, and over time helps people use the same language to mean the same things, wherever they work in government.

For more on functional standards, please see GovS 001, Government functions and the Guide to functional standards.
