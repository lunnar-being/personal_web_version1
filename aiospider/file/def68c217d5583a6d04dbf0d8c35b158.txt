Award Number: DE-EE0008154CX(s) Applied: A9, B5.15Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): NVOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to NV Energy to develop machine learning software applications for demand response operations in solar photovoltaic (PV) applications. The software would coordinate and integrate behind-the-meter (BTM) solar PV systems and energy storage, with the goal of improving management and service efficiency relating to these systems. The project would be completed over three Budget Periods (BPs), with a Go/No-Go Decision Point in between each BP.
