This guide is for British citizens travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa or permit.

Entry requirements

If you’re going to Spain to work (or any other EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) you must make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements.

On the day you travel, you’ll need your passport to both:


  have at least 6 months left
  be less than 10 years old (even if it has 6 months or more left)


If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attending business meetings.

These are usually covered by the Schengen visa waiver.

If you’re going for certain types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.

Spain’s authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. It decides which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.


You must always check with the Spanish government before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements.


If you’re working in more than one country you will need to check the entry rules of each country.

If you need a passport, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.

Visa and permit documents

This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in Spain. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.

It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with Spain’s immigration authorities or embassy.

You must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:


  translated
  
‘legalised’ (apostilised) or notarised
  originals, or if copies are acceptable
  signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)
  dated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application


Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa.

This guide uses the same terms used in Spain, so you know which ones to use when speaking to Spain’s authorities.

Check if you need a visa or permit

  meeting clients or customers (including entertainment like eating at a restaurant)
  receiving classroom-based training
  leisure travel, such as holidays or visiting friends or family


You must not receive any payment for these activities from a Spanish company or it could be classed as work.

EU intra-company transfer (EU ICT) permits from other countries

You do not require a visa or permit in Spain for up to 90 days in a 180-day period if you have an EU ICT permit from another country. Your employer needs to notify Spain’s immigration authorities.
