DOE’s funding of this project will develop critical refrigerant data to expedite the implementation of low GWP refrigerants in the U.S. market in a timely and less-costly way. The knowledge gained will help domestic manufacturers develop reliable and efficient products to compete in domestic and foreign markets.Xudong Wang, AHRI
