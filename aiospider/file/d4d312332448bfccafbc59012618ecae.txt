During the same period, the Czech digital economy experienced a much lower boost, at 8.8%. 
    
    
        
According to McKinsey’s 2020 Digital Challengers report, the CEE region has the foundations in place for further digitization in the next normal. They include strong macroeconomic performance (GDP per capita increased by 115% in the period 2004–2019), high-quality digital infrastructure, and a vibrant emerging digital ecosystem with CEE’s unicorns worth around EUR 31 billion. The region also boasts good primary and secondary education systems, as well as a large talent pool, with 216,000 graduates in STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in 2018. To realize the untapped digital potential, additional action is required by all stakeholders in the CEE countries. For a successful digital transformation in the next normal, the McKinsey report recommends that enterprises take a holistic approach by digitizing customer interactions, optimizing operations, and modernizing IT. In light of the rapid migration of consumers to digital technologies driven by the pandemic, policymakers might consider bringing more public services online and creating a digital ecosystem in which individuals and businesses can thrive. They can do this by supporting entrepreneurship, creating incentives for SMEs to digitize and cooperating with “tech clusters”—sectors that enhance the competitiveness of the region.
