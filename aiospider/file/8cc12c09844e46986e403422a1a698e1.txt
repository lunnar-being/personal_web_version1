COVID-19

We recognise the wide range of difficulties and issues Coronavirus is causing all our customers, especially those affected by recent moves to restrict the impact of the virus. 
If you are experiencing particular difficulties in paying, caused by Coronavirus or wish to request an electronic invoice, please contact us at licensinginvoices@marinemanagement.org.uk.


  Please note that electronic invoices will only be available for a limited period of time while people are remote working due to office closures and social distancing measures.



Fees are payable for different types of project based on the time it takes the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science to process the application.

An MMO case manager will notify you of the suitable fee band for your application. This can be changed if new information about your project makes a different band more suitable. If your application is moved to a different band, MMO will seek your agreement before doing any further work.

Where an application is to carry out more than 1 licensable activity and they fall in different fee bands, the higher fee band is payable.

For example, an application to dredge material and dispose of it at sea includes a band 3 project (dredging) and a band 2 project (disposal – if fewer than 1 million cubic metres), so the fees applied to the application will be band 3.

From 1 April 2019, the MMO will recover the costs for carrying out marine licence monitoring inspections for all existing licences that expire after 1st April 2020 and all new applications received after 1st April 2019.
