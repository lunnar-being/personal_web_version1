Award Number: DE-EE0008919CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Bioenergy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): ILOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to Gas Technology Institute (GTI) to develop a novel technology for the conversion of cellulosic biomass into drop-in biofuels. GTI would combine two previously developed biomass and hydrocarbon processing technologies into an integrated reformer system. Specifically, GTIâ€™s Cool Reforming technology (hydrocarbon processing) and Integrated Hydropyrolysis and Hydroconversion (IH2) technology (biomass processing) would be combined into a single system.
