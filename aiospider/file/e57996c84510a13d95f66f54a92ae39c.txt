Award Number: DE-EE0008978CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): COOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Colorado School of Mines (CSM) to develop novel polymer-based hole transport materials (HTM) for use in solar photovoltaic (PV) applications. The project would seek to develop the HTMs such that they are scalable and readily produced at a low cost, as compared to the current state of the technology. The project would be completed in a single Budget Period.
