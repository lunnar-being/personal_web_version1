Although almost all financial decision makers in Mexico view the current state of the economy as weak or neutral, expectation for the next 3 months is improving, with one third of the respondents expecting the economy to get stronger in the next 3 months. On the other hand, only 15% of respondents expect their personal financial situation to improve in the next 3 months, slightly upwards from August but still far from June's peak. Job security is still a concern for almost half of consumers, and over half have less than 4 months of savings. Banks are performing per expectations, but consumers would like reduced minimums and easier access to a line of credit. Half of financial decision makers are unsure about the economy after the COVID-19 crisis, but 35 percent are optimistic there will be a quick recoveryâ€”an increase of 11 percentual points since the beginning of August.
