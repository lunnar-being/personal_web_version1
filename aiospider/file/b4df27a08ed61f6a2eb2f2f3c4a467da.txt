This graphic shows how Natural Powerâ€™s Detection and Active Response Curtailment (DARC) system curtails wind turbine operation when bats are detected within the swept area of the turbine blades. Published results from the WETO-funded research project are still pending, but initial data analysis suggests DARC can increase power production and achieve similar bat fatality reduction potential compared to blanket curtailment.Subscribe to learn more about WETO R&D projects, news, accomplishments, and recent publications.Subscribe to the WETO e-newsletter to stay informed on the latest wind energy news, events, publications, and updates.
