A Statutory Document setting out the approach that traffic commissioners will adopt in response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Great Britain.

The document provides guidance for and advice on:


  operators who temporarily cannot meet the required financial standing levels
  when a transport manager is unable to attend work
  the period of grace process if the requirements to hold an operator’s licence cannot be met
  operators who are unable to access their operating centres
  the approach to be taken when considering the financial evidence of an operator applying for interim authorisation
  how the traffic commissioners may approach applications for temporary exemptions to the requirement to hold an operator’s licence
  the approach to be adopted for short notice requests around changes to local bus services and reducing the administrative burden on operators
  hearings attendance and the postponement of hearings


This Statutory Document was updated on 30 July 2020 to include guidance on:


  operators running duplicate services
  the 72 hour local authority notice period
