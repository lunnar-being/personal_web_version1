The Electrification of Heat Demonstration Project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a large-scale roll-out of heat pumps in Great Britain by installing heat pumps in a representative range of 750 homes. Additionally new products and services have been designed to overcome some of the barriers to deployment.

A competition to appoint 3 delivery contractors concluded in June 2020. The appointed delivery contractors are:


  E.ON who will undertake the trial in Newcastle
  OVO Energy who will undertake the trial in the South East of England
  Warmworks who will undertake the trial in the South East of Scotland


The project is closed for new applications. Details of the project’s aims and objectives can be found in the project guidance.

Apply to participate
Members of the public will be able to participate in the project. The heat pumps and energy efficiency upgrades (where appropriate) in eligible homes will be provided free of charge in return for participating in the research and monitoring aspects of the project across the 3 selected areas of Great Britain mentioned above.
