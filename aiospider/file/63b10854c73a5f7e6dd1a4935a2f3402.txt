To better understand the scope and impact of the changes, we launched the  Industry Survey, reaching out to mining operators globally to get a grip on what the coronavirus means for mining personnel, safety, productivity, production, and more.The insights gleaned from more than 60 senior mining executives gave us a more granular view on the state of the mining industry amid the pandemic.The survey shows that 75 percent of respondents agree that COVID-19 has had a significant impact on mining operations, while 65 percent say they expect fundamental changes to their operational models.The survey also indicates that the level of disruption triggered by the pandemic is moderate to high in many countries—including Brazil, Canada, Chile, South Africa, and the United States—with significant mining activity.The survey also finds that the pandemic triggered a decrease in production by about 42 percent, on average, while the planned production reduction for 2020 was roughly 30 percent. Respondents attribute this decrease to a reduction in demand and a limited workforce.Download the  for more insight (PDF–1.2MB).
