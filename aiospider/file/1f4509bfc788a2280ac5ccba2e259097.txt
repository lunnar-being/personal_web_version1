John O. Dabiri, PhD, is an aeronautical engineer who designs next-generation wind turbines with the potential to reduce cost, size, and environmental impacts while maximizing the amount of electricity generated.





Discoveries on the ideal placement of wind turbines were shaped by his cross-disciplinary research into how jellyfish and schools of fish move throughout the ocean efficiently.
Awarded the MacArthur “Genius” Fellowship, the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, and the Alan T. Waterman Award from the National Science Foundation.
Member of the NVIDIA Board of Directors and Trustee of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.
Serves on the National Academies Committee on Science, Technology, and Law.
Chair of the American Physical Society Division of Fluid Dynamics.
