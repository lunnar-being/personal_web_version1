Today, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and National Alliance for Water Innovation (NAWI) announced $5 million in federal funding to develop desalination technologies that will help bring freshwater supplies to communities across the nation.“These water innovation projects allow for incredible development to improve energy efficiency in desalination processes” . “By building a circular economy of water that is more energy efficient and powered by renewable electricity, we’re not only staying on our path towards continuous industry decarbonization, we’re also pushing our water and wastewater infrastructure one step further in the future, and carving out a cleaner, greener energy economy for generations to come.”Water sources for many communities contain high levels of salt and contaminants, a problem that can be intensified by changing precipitation patterns due to the climate crisis and regional population increase. Desalination can help diversify the range of accessible water resources. This will help the US meet net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 while also helping all Americans access new supplies of freshwater.The funding will support early-stage applied research on state-of-the-art, next generation technology desalination systems collaborative teams of industry, labs, and universities that treat non-traditional water sources.The projects selected specifically address challenges of managing concentrated brine waste streams that are a by-product of the desalination process.The projects selected are:NAWI is an Energy Innovation Hub funded by the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy’s (EERE)  to address the barriers and needs surrounding the cost and energy for the desalination of water.This announcement is part of DOE’s 2021 Future of Manufacturing campaign.
