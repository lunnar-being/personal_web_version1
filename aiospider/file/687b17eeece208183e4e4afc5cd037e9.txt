Contained within this document is the approach of the Traffic Commissioners’ and Deputy Traffic Commissioners’ Appraisal Scheme.

It also shows what the scheme intends to achieve in terms of objectives and overall outcomes and how it will achieve those objectives and outcomes.

It relies heavily on the Judicial Skills and Abilities Framework 2014 and the JSB Appraisal Standards and Appraiser Competences in Tribunals Framework (December 2009).

It applies to all traffic commissioners and deputy traffic commissioners.
