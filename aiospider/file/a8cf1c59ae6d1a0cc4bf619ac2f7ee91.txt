1. Introduction / Background

The following legislation provides the legal requirements for the measurement of a ship’s tonnage for registration purposes:


  
    The Merchant Shipping Act 1995:

    
      
        Section 10 - Registration regulations;
      
      
        Section 11 - Tonnage ascertained for registration to be tonnage of ship; and
      
      
        Section 19 - Tonnage regulations;
      
    
  
  
    The Merchant Shipping (Tonnage) Regulations 1997 (SI 1997 No. 1510):

    
      
        Part II - Application, Ascertainment of Tonnage and Certification for United Kingdom Ships of 24 Metres in 
Length and Over; and
      
      
        Part III - Application, Ascertainment of Tonnage and Certification for United Kingdom Ships of Less Than 24 
Metres in Length, Other Than Fishing Vessels;
      
    
  
  
    The Merchant Shipping (Registration of Ships, and Tonnage) (Amendment) Regulations 1999 (SI 1999 No. 3206); and
  
  
    The Merchant Shipping (Fishing Vessels – Tonnage) Regulations 1988 (SI 1988 No.1909) (Apply to fishing vessels under 24 m length).
  


The legislation also requires that the person undertaking tonnage measurements satisfies the requirements set out by the MCA.

Recognised Organisations (ROs) are those organisations the UK has recognised to comply with its international obligations in relation to the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) Code for Recognised Organisations.

Small commercial vessel (SCV) Certifying Authorities (CAs) are those organisations the UK has authorised to examine and certificate SCVs in accordance with the requirements of the following legislation:


  
    The Merchant Shipping (Small Workboats and Pilot Boats) Regulations 1998 (SI 1998 No.1609 as amended); and
  
  
    The Merchant Shipping (Vessels in Commercial Use for Sport or Pleasure) Regulations 1998 (SI 1998 No. 2771 as amended).
  


Fishing vessel (FV) Certifying Authorities (CAs) are those organisations the UK has authorised to examine and certificate small fishing vessels in accordance with the applicable requirements of the following legislation and codes:


  
    The Fishing Vessels (Codes of Practice) Regulations 2017;
  
  
    The Merchant Shipping (Registration of Ships) Regulations 1993l
  
  
    MSN 1871 as maybe amended, (The Code of Practice for the Safety of Small Fishing Vessels of less than 15m Length Overall);
  
  
    MSN 1872 as maybe amended, (The Code of Safe Working Practice for the Construction and Use of Fishing Vessels of 15m Length Overall to less than 24m Registered Length)

ROs are authorised to undertake tonnage measurement of all UK ships.

SCV CAs are authorised to undertake tonnage measurement of ships under 24 metres in length excluding fishing vessels. SCV CAs are also authorised to undertake tonnage measurement of pre-ITC’69 vessels (keel laid before 21st July 1968) of less than 150 tons but 24m in length or over.
