This month, the U.S. Testing Expertise and Access to Marine Energy Research (TEAMER) program  through its first Request for Technical Support (RFTS) Selected projects will receive technology support with modeling and analysis; laboratory and bench tests; and tank, flume, tunnel, and basin tests. Supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and directed by the Pacific Ocean Energy Trust (POET), TEAMER accelerates the viability of marine renewables by providing access to the nationâ€™s best facilities and expertise in order to solve challenges, build knowledge, foster innovation, and drive commercialization.The following projects will receive technical support:Open-water testing will be available in future RFTS cycles.The three-year  supports testing and research for marine energy technologies and will provide access to test facilities and technical expertise to assist with numerical modeling and data collection in operational and extreme conditions.
