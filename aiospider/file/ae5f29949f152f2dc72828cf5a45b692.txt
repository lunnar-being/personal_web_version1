Award Number: DE-EE0009064CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Building Technologies OfficeLocation(s): CAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) to develop an Integrated Mechanical System Pod (IMSP) for buildings with individual unit heating, ventilation, airconditioning (HVAC), and domestic hot water (DHW) systems; and an IMSP for buildings with central HVAC and DHW systems. These IMSPs would be all-electric and assembled from readily available components to provide space heating and cooling, ventilation, domestic hot water, and controls for low, mid, and high-rise multifamily buildings. Control systems would be designed to be grid-interactive and to integrate with on-site photovoltaic (PV) systems and energy storage systems. A range of system sizes would also be investigated as proof of concept beyond pilot building requirements so that the pods could be deployed across all US climate zones.
