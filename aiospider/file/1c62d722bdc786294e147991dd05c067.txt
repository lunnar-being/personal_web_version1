Alpine University, Kitzbühel, May 7–8, 2020Supply chains are becoming longer and more complex, the context in which they operate is continually evolving, and new technologies to manage them—such as digital and automation—are emerging with increasing frequency. Discussions around Digital Supply Chain and Supply Chain 4.0 are at the heart of many organizations’ planning processes.However, as with so many digital transformations, it’s hard for companies to know which technologies to adopt, and how to capture the full value available by making a sustainable step change and implementing them at scale.The first Supply Chain Executive Academy of 2020 will take place in May, with a focus on supply chain planning and execution. The event is particularly targeted to heads of supply chains, transformation officers, senior managers of supply chain-related functions, and supply chain executives from major manufacturing or distribution companies.During the Academy, we will introduce a balanced mix of case studies and presentations on the newest developments, and offer collaborative discussions with McKinsey experts on today's most important supply chain topics. You will also experience the transformational power of startups and learn how to instill digital techniques into your business. There will be plenty of opportunity to exchange ideas and experiences with other senior supply chain executives from leading global companies, as well as with “digital natives”.The McKinsey Supply Chain Executive Academy will take place at the Alpine University in Kitzbühel, Austria, with the main program on Thursday, May 8, and Friday May 9. A welcome dinner is planned for Wednesday, May 7.Capacity for this event is limited. For information or to register, please contact , supply chain partner, or , supply chain senior expert.
