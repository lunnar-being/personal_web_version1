Digital currencies are on the rise. More than a decade after bitcoin made cryptocurrency mainstream, countries and central banks are evaluating whether to issue their own digital cash. The Belfer Center’s Economic Diplomacy Initiative (EDI) is exploring how policymakers should manage economic policy and the national security implications of this disruptive trend.Panelists and audience members gather around the mock “Situation Room” for the Digital Currency Wars Simulation in November 2019. (Michael DeStefano)To illustrate the challenges posed by digital currency, EDI conducted a national security crisis simulation in Harvard Kennedy School’s JFK Jr. Forum. The simulation featured Harvard and MIT faculty and former government officials portraying National Security Council (NSC) members. Meeting in the “White House Situation Room,” the participants debated how to respond to a North Korea missile test that demonstrated significant advancements in the country’s nuclear program. Those nuclear capabilities were funded using a Chinese digital currency, which U.S. authorities could not track.The participants included: While the scenario was fictionalized, it was based on the real and rapid developments in digital currency technology, led by China’s efforts to launch a digital yuan and Facebook’s proposed Libra coin.The simulation facilitated a policy discussion on the potential role of digital currencies in the global economy and its implications for U.S. national security. It showed how initiatives to develop alternative monetary systems affect the ability of the U.S. to implement sanctions, monitor illicit activities, and uphold data privacy standards. The simulation also illustrated the inner dynamics and decision-making processes of officials in the Situation Room.
