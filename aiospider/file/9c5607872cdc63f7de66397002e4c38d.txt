In Italy, optimism about the economy among consumers has doubled between February 2021 and October 2021. Net spending intent is rising, and over one-third of consumers want to splurge. More than half of Italian consumers shop omnichannel in most product categories, often influenced by social media. Almost three-fourths reported trying a new shopping behavior, often buying a new brand, and a majority who experienced a stockout said they went to another retailer to buy. Seven in ten described modifying out-of-home behavior because of COVID-19, but out-of-home activity has increased. Spending intentions for the holidays remain similar to last year, and four in ten said they intend to start shopping earlier this year.These exhibits are based on survey data collected in Italy from October 15 to 22, 2021. Check back for regular updates on Italian consumer sentiments, behaviors, income, spending, and expectations.
