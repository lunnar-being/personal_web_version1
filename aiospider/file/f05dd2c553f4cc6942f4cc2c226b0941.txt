Award Number: DE-EE0008846CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6, B3.15Fuel Cell Technologies OfficeLocation(s): COOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to the University of Colorado Boulder to develop a low-cost large scale process for co-production of hydrogen and carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with the intended use of the CNFs being concrete reinforcement. Research would be carried out at the University of Colorado in Boulder, CO. Industrial partners (ALD NanoSolutions, Inc.; Broomfield, CO and National Ready Mixed Concrete Association; Silver Spring, MD) would provide market assessment, catalyst cost assessment, techno-economic analysis/process engineering analysis, and commercial partnerships. Both partners would provide consulting work only.
