Follow our link for a list of lawyers/interpreters who may be able to help you with official transactions in Laos. Please note that inclusion in this list does not constitute official endorsement by the British Embassy Vientiane or the UK government.

Note: A lawyer seeking to represent a foreign national in a criminal matter may need to obtain prior permission from the Lao Ministry of Justice. Court proceedings are only conducted in Lao language. An interpreter can be provided by the Lao Justice Department at the expense of the accused.
