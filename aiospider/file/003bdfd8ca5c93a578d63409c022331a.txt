The proposed change involves sending highly enriched uranium, HEU, from Y-12 to the BWX Technologies, Inc., BWXT, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NRC, licensed Category 1 facility, SNM-124, in Erwin, TN for conversion from HEU metal to HEU oxide. BWXT will then ship the oxide from their Erwin, TN plant to their Lynchburg, VA plant, SNM-42, for down-blending and TRISO fabrication.
