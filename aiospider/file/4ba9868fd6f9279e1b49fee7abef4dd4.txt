The U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s Bioenergy Technologies Office funds research and development on technologies necessary for the deployment and production of cost-competitive bioenergy, primarily biofuels. Results of experimental efforts are periodically compiled and compared with benchmark technology designs to assess overall progress. This report provides a status of those R&D efforts at the end of 2019. Download the report below.
