Award Number: DE-EE0009084CX(s) Applied: A9, A11Building Technologies OfficeLocation(s): MAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships (NEEP) to develop and streamline the energy code inspection process for prefabricated home construction. NEEP would further develop a standardized DOE field research methodology to include best practices for off-site and prefabricated construction methods. NEEP would also research and develop guidance on the performance of virtual inspections. As part of the project, NEEP would perform on-site visits to facilities that manufacture prefabricated components/modules in order to collect data on the performance of routine operations.
