Award Number: DE-EE0008934CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Bioenergy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): CAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to University of California, Berkeley (UCB) to develop conceptual designs for multi-input, multi-output biorefineries that can convert lignocellulosic biomass, manure, and other wet organic waste into liquid fuels, platform chemicals, and other products. Lifecycle analyses (LCA) and technoeconomic analyses (TEA) would be performed using data collected from a commercial fermentation system and laboratory-scale testing. A biorefinery analysis web tool would also be developed as part of the project and made publicly available.
