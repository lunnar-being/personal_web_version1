Award Number: DE-EE0009256CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6, B1.31Bioenergy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): ALOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to University of Alabama (UA) to optimize and scale up a previously developed industrial milling technology (i.e., Szego Mill) for use in the production of hydrolysate from corn stover. A previously assembled, laboratory-scale Szego Mill would be used as the basis for system design improvements. UA would assess the operations of the existing unit and then design, fabricate, and test small and larger pilot-scale prototypes, with increased production capacity, as compared to the existing laboratory-scale device.
