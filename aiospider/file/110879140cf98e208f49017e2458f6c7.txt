Award Number: DE-EE0008377CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Fuel Cell Technologies OfficeLocation(s): MAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Saint-Gobain Ceramics & Plastics (Saint-Gobain) to develop a high temperature electrolysis technology which would combine a nickelate-based anode material with an all ceramic stack design. The project would seek to reduce material degradation in solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) through the development of novel nickelate-based compositions, which would be integrated into specially designed SOEC stacks.
