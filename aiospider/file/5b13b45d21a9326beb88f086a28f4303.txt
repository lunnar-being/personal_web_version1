This list is regularly updated, with the most recent additions at the top of the spreadsheet.


Access wider defence science and technology research through Athena

Dstl manages a central repository, known as Athena, on behalf of the Ministry of Defence (MOD). Athena stores MOD-sponsored scientific and technical research reports, which are available to the wider defence and security community (including government, industry and academia) in accordance with security, legal and commercial conditions.

Submit your research report to Athena

Read guidance about how to submit a report to Athena.

Request full-text research reports

You can request the full text of reports listed in Defence Reporter or the Defence Research Citations email alerts  by completing either:


  ‘Need to know’ form for UK Nationals (ODT, 24.8KB)


or


  'Need to know' form for Foreign Nationals (ODT, 24.7KB)


Email the completed form to the Report Request Team at athenareportrequests@dstl.gov.uk

The Report Request Team will release the requested report depending on the classification and release conditions of the report.

Find out more about Athena

For information about how MOD employees can access the Athena report collection via the MOD secure networks, please contact athenaenquiries@dstl.gov.uk

Athena welcomes your feedback and any suggestions you may have for further development of Athena’s products and services. Please send your comments to athenaenquiries@dstl.gov.uk

Policy for re-use of information

Dstl follows the National Archives’ Re-use of public sector information policy and have adopted the Open Government Licence (OGL) v3.0 for licensing Dstl Crown copyright material cleared for use/re-use.

Charging policy

Pursuant to the Re-Use of Public Sector Information Regulations 2015, documents supplied by Dstl as part of the MOD Public Task (see page 15 for relevant information) will be available for re-use unless they are excluded by virtue of exemptions in the 2015 Regulations.

If the requested material is within MOD’s public task then there will generally be no fee for re-use. However, if the requested material is fully outside MOD’s public task, additional charges will apply. Due to the varying nature of the material available for re-use, no standard fee structure is available. However please contact CrownCopyrightLicensing@dstl.gov.uk for details of any charges in relation to particular requests.

Complaints procedure

If you are not satisfied with the service you have received with respect to licensing of Crown copyright material, please get in touch with your regular Dstl contact and discuss your concerns with them. Alternatively, you could ask to speak to their manager. If, however, the problem has not been resolved or handled to your satisfaction, or you do not have a regular Dstl contact, you may wish to make a formal complaint.

To make a complaint, please write to:


    Head of Intellectual Property

    
      Finance, Planning and Governance DivisionDstlSalisburySP4 0JQ
    





If you remain dissatisfied with the response from Dstl’s Head of Intellectual Property, you are entitled to seek redress through MOD’s formal complaints procedure by writing to the Ministerial Correspondence Unit. Alternatively, you may wish to contact the Standards Division of the Office of Public Sector Information.
