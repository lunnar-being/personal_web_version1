Award Number: DE-EE0009063CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Building Technologies OfficeLocation(s): MDOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to the Home Innovation Research Labs (HIRL) to develop, fabricate, and test a novel retrofit wall panel. HIRL would develop novel configurations integrating vacuum insulated panels to optimize panel performance (e.g. cost, thermal performance, moisture resistance, durability). The best performing configurations would then be subjected to laboratory performance testing.
