Management wisdom teaches us that structure must follow strategy. As a result, companies over decades have first designed their strategy and subsequently taken the operating model and organizational choices that best support it.Yet, in a world becoming more granular, heterogeneous, uncertain and dynamic across markets and regions, the strategic choices companies make have also become more fluid and more contextual to each specific market. For example, while consumer goods companies previously leveraged the power of global brands without significantly tailoring their commercial strategy and associated operating model, the increasing heterogeneity of markets demands more flexible operating models that cater to different contexts.This two-part blog series for consumer goods companies will outline the recommended considerations to tailor operating models according to mature and emerging markets, respectively.In fact, many have not yet fully embraced the need to adjust their operating model to the mature vs. emerging world. For example:The heterogeneous market landscape, shaped by a dichotomy of growth in emerging markets and stagnation (but still significant size and margin) in mature markets, needs a more tailored approach.

Frequently, these choices differ across the many imperatives of an operating model, such as structure, talent and decision making.In this post, weâ€™re focusing on three things consumer goods companies should consider with respect to mature markets:In our , we discuss the considerations associated with tailoring operating models to meet the needs of emerging markets in the coming decades.
