This October, the Technology Transfer Working Group (TTWG) issued its annual awards celebrating the professionals who help transform DOE’s work from research into reality through commercialization. The TTWG is comprised of the leading staff in technology transfer across DOE’s 17 National Laboratories, and these awards celebrate the excellent work done by those teams to streamline and improve the commercialization process. This year’s winners support American competitiveness, national security, and quality of life by tackling tough policy and partnership challenges that help usher scientific discoveries out of the lab and toward the market. Congratulations to these outstanding professionals for their dedication and service to the Department and our country!Tech Partnership & Business DevelopmentSandia National LaboratoriesMatthew GarrettOak Ridge National LaboratoryBob WesterveltSandia National LaboratoriesGenaro Mempin, Alicera Aubel, Ines Gomez, Jonathan CelnikerLawrence Livermore National LaboratoryJon CookIdaho National LaboratoryAnnemarie MeikeLawrence Livermore National LaboratoryKelli HowieSandia National LaboratoriesAndrew RankinIdaho National LaboratoryFermi National Accelerator Laboratory
