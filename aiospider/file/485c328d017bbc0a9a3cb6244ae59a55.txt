The program would build on existing Energy Management and Building Controls (EM/BC) programs currently offered by LCC. These programs would be developed further through the creation of an apprenticeship program and a peer mentoring program. Program participants would be connected with industry partners and complete a hands-on apprenticeship. An educational component would be developed for the program. This component would be provided via an online platform.
