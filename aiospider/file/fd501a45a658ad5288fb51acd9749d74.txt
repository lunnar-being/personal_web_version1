North Sea Fully Documented Fisheries (FDF)

Fully Documented Fishery (FDF) schemes have been run by the MMO since 2011. These schemes have demonstrated the effectiveness of Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM) in reducing discards and encouraging more selective fishing behaviour.

The behaviour of vessels fitted with REM has also been compared to vessels fishing in the same areas, using the same gear types, and has shown differences in both catch composition and grading.

In addition, REM has proven to be a useful tool for gathering scientific data.  The MMO has collaborated with the Centre for the Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Sciences (Cefas) on exploring this use.

Application forms and guidance are available.

This scheme has been run since 2011.  Results of the scheme are published online.

Vessels which wish to apply, must do so by Monday 22nd June 2020.  To apply, the vessel must be English-registered, and preferably a member of a Producer Organisation (PO), however, applications will also be considered from vessels in the non-sector.

Where a vessel is new to the scheme, they will have to arrange for a suitable MMO approved REM  system to fitted at their own expense.

In return for participation in this scheme, vessels will be able to access additional quota for North Sea stocks, however the species and quotas available have not been finalised.  In addition, scientific quota may be available.

The scheme will run from July 1st until 31st December 2020.

The aims of the scheme in 2020 are to:


  Demonstrate how a Fully Documented Fishery can increase compliance with the Landing Obligation.
  Monitor catches of species subject to the Landing Obligation, including species below the minimum conservation reference size and discards.
  Understand the effectiveness of any technical measures introduced in 2020.
  Demonstrate the issues faced by vessels in complying with the landing obligation, and the difficulties it introduces.


If you have any questions, please contact: ukcatchquota@defra.gov.uk or call the MMO helpline 0300 123 1032
