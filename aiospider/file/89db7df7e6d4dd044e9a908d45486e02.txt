Award Number: DE-EE0009331CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6, B5.15Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): WAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to StorEdgeAI to develop and test a novel solar-powered non-wire energy carrier. The device would be designed to store energy produced by solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Prototype versions of the energy carrier device would be developed and tested in laboratory settings and outdoors at a dedicated solar farm. The project would be completed over two Budget Periods (BPs), with a Go/No-Go Decision Point in between each BP.
