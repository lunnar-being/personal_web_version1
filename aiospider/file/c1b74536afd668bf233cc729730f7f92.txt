Update 17 September 2021

This competition is now closed to applications

Update 7 July 2021


  Competition guidance updated: academic, research, public, third sector and/or community organisations can apply to the competition as sole applicants, they are not required to partner with private sector organisations. See criterion 10, section 5.1 on p. 32 of the Stream 2 competition guidance.


(This only applies to Stream 2 – first-of-a-kind prototypes (contracts). Stream 1 remains as stated in criterion 1, section 5.1, p.31 of the Stream 1 guidance).


This competition aims to accelerate commercialisation of innovative longer duration energy storage projects through to actual demonstrations (Stream 1) or to first-of-a-kind (FOAK) full-system prototypes (Stream 2).

We are looking for proposals for electrical storage, thermal storage and power-to-x technologies which can provide novel grid services and demonstrate cost reductions and improvement in technology performance.

They should not include commercial solutions such as pumped hydro or lithium ion.

The competition has 2 Streams. See Stream 1 for pre-commercial demonstrator grants

Stream 2: Pre-commercial first-of-a-kind prototype proposals (contracts) - overview

Stream 2 of the competition is focused on pre-commercial FOAK prototype proposals.

To be in scope technologies must:


  not be commercially deployed in the UK or elsewhere
  be at technology readiness level (TRL) 4 or 5


£30.5 million of competition funding is available for Stream 2 and will be awarded using the Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) contracts approach:


  a maximum of £1.5 million for Phase 1 feasibility studies, with a maximum value of £150,000 per project. We intend to fund around 12 projects in Phase 1
  £29 million is currently allotted to Phase 2 demonstration projects, with the maximum expected funding per project of £9.45 million. We intend to fund around 3 projects in Phase 2


Key dates

1. Information event

We held a competition event on 17 June 2021 to support applicants in developing their application.

2. Questions about the competition

If you have questions that aren’t covered in the guidance here, please send them to storage.innovation@beis.gov.uk by 2pm on 7 July 2021. Questions submitted after this deadline may not be answered.
