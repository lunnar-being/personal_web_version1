However, the high-efficiency HVAC and DHW technologies that are currently available are up to four times more efficient. To address this gap, ICAST will pilot test the installation of high-efficiency heat pump based HVAC and DHW systems to collect key data points on annual energy and cost savings. The project team will use the collected data to demonstrate the potential return on investment for building owners and promote broad demand for high-efficiency technologies throughout the multifamily market.By driving very high-efficiency technology use in multifamily properties, this project will accelerate the introduction of combined high-efficiency HVAC and DHW systems that are not currently available in the U.S. ICAST estimates total energy savings of approximately 362 million kWh and total utility cost savings of about $540 million for every 100,000 such systems installed as a result of this project.
