Award Number: DE-EE0008998CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): INOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Purdue University to design, fabricate, and test novel ceramic/metal (cermet) heat exchangers for use in concentrated solar power (CSP) applications. The heat exchangers would be developed so as to be resistant to corrosion, creep, fracture, and thermal cycling when transferring heat from high temperature molten salt to supercritical carbon dioxide-based fluid. The project would be completed over three Budget Periods (BPs), with a Go/No-Go Decision Point in between each BP.
