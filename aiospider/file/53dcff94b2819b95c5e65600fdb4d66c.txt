You can also read ‘Ofsted EIF inspections and the EYFS’ – what early years providers need to know about inspection, the EYFS and the pandemic.


This handbook is primarily a guide for Ofsted inspectors on how to carry out inspections.

We also publish this for childcare providers so that they are aware of Ofsted’s inspection processes and procedures under the education inspection framework (EIF).
