These funding manuals provide information to schools and ITT providers on School Direct (salaried) funding in England, including:


  criteria and requirements
  funding rates and funded subjects
  how payments are made
  reconciliation, assurance and audit


The School Direct (salaried) route allows schools to:


  request training places directly
  select the ITT provider of teacher training they want to work with
  agree the content and focus of the training programme depending on their needs


Schools can choose and recruit the candidate they want with an expectation that the trainee will be employed by the school or wider partnership of schools.

ITT funding rates and guidance for schools and ITT providers are available.
