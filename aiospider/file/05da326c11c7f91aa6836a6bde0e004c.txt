Moderna and Pfizer–BioNTech are expected to deliver sufficient COVID-19-vaccine doses to inoculate all high-risk Americans, including healthcare personnel, frontline workers, and long-term-care-facility residents, in the first half of 2021. Additionally, other COVID-19 vaccines, including those approved in other markets (for example, the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine), are likely to become available.
