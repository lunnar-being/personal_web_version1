Award Number: DE-EE0009361CX(s) Applied: A9Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): MIOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to the Regents of the University of Michigan to characterize how knowledge flows and trusted stakeholders affect rural communitiesâ€™ decisions on zoning utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV), develop a scalable model for estimating the short- and long-term impacts of utility-scale PV deployments in rural economies, and test mechanisms for disseminating information on how utility-scale PV would affect rural economies. The proposed study system encompasses rural regions of MN, MI, WI, IL, IN, and OH.
