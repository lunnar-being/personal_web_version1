          Details


          

    
            
The £40 million Red Diesel Replacement competition aims to support the development and demonstration of low carbon fuel and system alternatives to red diesel for the construction, and mining and quarrying sectors. The competition will support the decarbonisation of these high-impact sectors that will be affected by the partial removal of the entitlement to use red diesel and rebated fuels from April 2022.

The competition is part of the £1 billion Net Zero Innovation Portfolio (NZIP).

It will be delivered in 2 phases.

Phase 1

A total of £9.2 million will be available in grant funding for Phase 1, with up to £460,000 per project.

Projects must develop technologies within any of the 3 innovation lots at technology readiness level (TRL) 4 and above:


  Lot 1: Distribution, storage and energy delivery systems development
  Lot 2: Development of equipment (components/sub-systems) and fleet management infrastructure (facilities for maintaining, hosting and servicing vehicles)
  Lot 3: Fuel development


Phase 2

A total of £30 million will be available in grant funding for Phase 2, with up to £15 million per project.

Projects must be at TRL 5-6 and demonstrate a low carbon integrated system that includes elements of all 3 technology lots from Phase 1 on a construction and mining/quarrying site. Projects must demonstrate that the technology is at TRL 7 upon completion.

How to apply

Phase 1 of the competition is open for applications.
