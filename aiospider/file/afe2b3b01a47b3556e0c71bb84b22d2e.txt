In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered an unprecedented fall in global oil demand of some 20–25 mbd, or roughly 20 percent. Faced with considerable oversupply and collapsing prices, US operators moved quickly to reduce drilling activity and shut in production from active assets, reducing their oil output by about 2.3 mbd. By June 2020, the top 10 US exploration and production (E&P) operators had shut in 0.8 mbd of production in the US Lower 48 states—representing between 50 and 60 percent of total onshore US curtailment—as well as reducing their capex programs by 30 to 50 percent. However, as prices began to recover and stabilize at around $40 per barrel for WTI, operators started bringing curtailed production back online, a process that should be completed by October 2020 (Exhibit 1).The return of curtailed production represents what we see as the first phase in a three-phase recovery that is based on well economics. Taking the Permian basin as an example for pricing purposes, the phases are:The progression from phase 1 to phase 3 is sensitive to the behavior of individual operators, and depends partly on the level of DUC inventory they decide to maintain.Permian drilling activity fell sharply from a peak of 449 wells in January to a low of 134 wells in September, although numbers have been stabilizing since June. Meanwhile, completion activity decreased from 438 wells in January to 98 wells in July. Since well completion lags well spud by 3.5 months on average, this reduction in activity has led to an increase in the working inventory of DUCs, reaching an “excess” of roughly 1,100 wells over the normal level. As completion trends began to increase with 155 wells in August, the spud rate remained flat, indicating that the pool of DUC wells is beginning to be consumed (Exhibit 2).On the assumption that Permian completion rates gradually return to 60–80 percent of pre-pandemic levels, reducing the excess DUC inventory would take 16 months and cover about 1,000 wells. Some 800 of these are expected to be completed by mid-2021, contributing 0.3–0.4 mbd to Permian production. We expect the inventory overhang to act as a minor, if persistent, headwind to new drilling activity until normal inventory levels are restored by the end of 2021.Under this scenario, new drilling activity rebounds during the first quarter of 2021, with some 2,300 new wells producing 1.1 mbd and offsetting most of the decline by the second quarter (Exhibit 3).As demand and prices gradually recover, the industry faces new questions.By the second quarter of 2021, we expect US Lower 48 onshore production to rebound to roughly 80 percent of pre-pandemic levels, from a low of 7.9 mbd to 8.7 mbd.   About a quarter of the incremental production is expected to come from the completion of excess DUC inventory, and the remainder from new drilling activity. However, global oil demand is not expected to recover fully until 2024–26.
