The  (BETO) and  (AMO) within the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy have issued a joint Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) titled “.” This FOA supports the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s)  a comprehensive program to accelerate innovations in energy-efficient plastics recycling technologies. The FOA will support high-impact research and development for plastics by developing new plastics that are capable of efficient recyclability and by improving recycling strategies that can break existing plastics into chemical building blocks that can be used to make higher-value products.In addition, the FOA will seek partners for the newly launched National Laboratory-led , focused on designing new plastics and recycling strategies in collaboration with industry and academia.Topic Areas include:Learn more about the full FOA on  and , as well as through the  and the DOE press release.
