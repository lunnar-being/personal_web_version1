The 5G supply chain diversification strategy will deliver lasting and meaningful change in the 5G supply chain and pave the way for a vibrant, innovative and dynamic market.

Within it we have set out our long-term vision for a healthy supply market, which is characterised by the principles of openness, flexibility and diversity. This means building an environment where competition and innovation bring forward new deployment models based on open interfaces and interoperable standards; where networks are flexible, built on a best of breed approach and made up of an array of suppliers; and where security standards are adopted by all operators and suppliers to ensure the robustness and resilience of our networks.
