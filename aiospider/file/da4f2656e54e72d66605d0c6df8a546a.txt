Pooled testing is a safe and effective way of testing swab samples from several people at the same time. Several swab samples are combined into one plastic tube and are processed together to detect COVID-19.

The pooled testing pilot for universities is separate from the roll-out of rapid result tests (also called lateral flow tests) to university students.
