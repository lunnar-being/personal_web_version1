Currently, we are working on creating an accessible version of the Defence Commercial Graduate Programme brochure 2021. We will update the website with the accessible version in due course.



Many thanks for your interest in the Defence Commercial Graduate Programme. The advert for the recruitment of the 2021 Graduate Cohort will open on 22nd March 2021 and will close on the 19 April 2021.

You can sign up to Civil Service Jobs Website now and set a job alert with the criteria of ‘Commercial’ for the job role and you will be sent an alert to notify you when the advert goes live.


From army boots to aircraft and everything in between, the MOD purchases a range of equipment every year to support the armed forces in both UK and overseas operations.

And it doesn’t stop there; much of the equipment we purchase doesn’t come off the shelf so an essential part of the job is negotiating the details of the contracts we place, agreeing the terms of delivery and managing the equipment into service and beyond.

The Defence Commercial Graduate Programme is recruited for annually and is a 2 year commercial development programme. Graduates with a minimum 2:2 degree (or equivalent) in any subject are eligible to apply, however those with degrees in business management, law, politics, finance, science, engineering or defence-related disciplines may be particularly interested. Applicants are assessed via the MOD Management Competency Test and an assessment centre.
