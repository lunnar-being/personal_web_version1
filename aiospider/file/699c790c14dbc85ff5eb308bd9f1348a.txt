Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) refers to the range of neurodevelopmental problems caused by pre-natal exposure to alcohol.

This FASD health needs assessment provides an accessible and objective information resource on FASD, for use at national and local level and those with a personal or professional interest in the issue.

It was developed in collaboration with a range of professionals around the country. It:


  summarises the current state of research and policy
  presents relevant data where available to explain the extent and types of health needs
  reviews current health systems and services
