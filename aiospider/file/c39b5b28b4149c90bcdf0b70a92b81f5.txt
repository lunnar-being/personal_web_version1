Traineeships are programmes of education and training that help young people get the skills and experience they need to get an apprenticeship or a job.

The 2020 to 2021 framework for delivery covers the period from 1 September 2020 to 31 July 2021.

Information about traineeships for providers, employers and young people is also available.
