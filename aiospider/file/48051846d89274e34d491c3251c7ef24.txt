 –  workers have demolished two of the final eight DOE-owned buildings remaining at the former  (ETEC) site in Ventura County, California.“We’re in the final leg of DOE’s commitment to complete demolition at ETEC, safely and on time. Our partnership with the state of California has been vital to getting the ETEC site to final cleanup and completion, and our crews are committed to ensuring the site remains safe for the surrounding communities,” ETEC Federal Project Director John Jones said.Crews tore down the two structures in recent weeks. In just one day in November, they safely knocked down a small structure once used for the storage of non-radioactive chemical waste as they worked around an old oak tree to preserve it. Days later, they demolished a building that had been used to treat reactive metals, including potassium and sodium.The two buildings made up the Hazardous Waste Management Facility. Workers are on track to finish cleanup of that facility and safely ship the demolition debris for offsite disposal this month.After the remaining six buildings are taken down, DOE intends to continue working with the state of California on final cleanup. This work includes removing remaining sub-grade portions of the buildings and cleanup of groundwater and soils.In early November, workers advanced an  by safely and successfully  at the Radioactive Materials Handling Facility at ETEC.
