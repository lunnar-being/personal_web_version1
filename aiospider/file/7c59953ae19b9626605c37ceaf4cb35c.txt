          Details


          

    
            
We are developing our simplified bid pack for bidders. This is replacing the existing ‘Invitation To Tender’ pack which has been used for several years.

We are also developing simplified terms. In its beta version, the simplified bid pack uses split terms. Here you can find our general terms and conditions, along with our schedule templates. These take our existing terms and split them in two:

The clauses that rarely change are held on this web page, along with our schedule templates:


  Framework General Terms and Conditions
  Framework Schedule templates
  Call Off General Terms and Conditions
  Call Off Schedule templates


Any optional or amended clauses and the schedules as customised for each procurement will be held in the bid pack. This is to help you focus on what is different for each procurement.

How all these work together will be explained in each bid pack. You can access the bid packs through our eSourcing suite.

Future versions of our simplified bid pack will use much simpler terms later this
year. We will announce when we start to use them.
