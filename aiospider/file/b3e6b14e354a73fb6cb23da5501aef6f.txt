The majority of financial decision makers in Sweden view the economy as neutral and expect it to stay the same or improve in the next 3 months. Half of consumers believe their current financial situation is somewhat strong or strong and over 80% expect it to remain the same or improve in the next 3 months. Only one third of consumers have job concerns, but almost half have less than 4 months of savings to live off. Consumers believe bank performance is on par with their expectations but would like them to reduce payments or interest rates on mortgages and loans.
