          Details


          

    
            
The Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations (DSPCR) 2011 implemented the European Union (EU) Defence and Security Procurement Directive into United Kingdom (UK) law.  They came into force on 21 August 2011.

The DSPCR is ‘retained EU law’ by virtue of section 2 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.  This means that the regulations will remain in place and continue to have effect after 31 December 2020 (Transition Period completion day) in the UK.

However, the DSPCR has been amended by two Statutory Instruments to ensure the rules continues to operate effectively after the UK leaves the EU.  Those Statutory Instruments are: The Defence and Security Public Contracts (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 and The Defence and Security Public Contracts (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020.  After 31 December 2020, the DSPCR are national regulations which sit outside the Directive.


Important note, the current Chapter 4 guidance on Exemptions and Exclusions replaces two documents that previously covered the subjects separately.  There is therefore no guidance entitled Chapter 5.
