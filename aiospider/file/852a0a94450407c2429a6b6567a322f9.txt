To build a good model, we must start with good data. The Office of Science supports long-term field experiments involving the world’s most climate-sensitive ecosystems. Major DOE efforts are underway to study how clouds and aerosols impact climate. Field studies are tested with modeling to better understand the carbon cycle.If we use observational data to test Earth system models, where do we get real-world data for climate scenarios that haven’t happened yet? We turn up the heat in field experiments like —Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments. The SPRUCE warming experiment simulates climate change warming scenarios in the peatlands of northern Minnesota. Peatlands are wet bogs where plants cannot easily decompose and release carbon. Instead, the carbon is trapped in water-logged plant matter. While peatlands only cover three percent of the Earth’s surface, they store one-third of the world’s land-based carbon. SPRUCE consists of several pods where scientists warm the air and ground to simulate different future warming scenarios.Climate modeling projections can help decision-makers—such as city governments, energy providers, and home and business owners—prepare for the future. Researchers supported by the Office of Science-funded  project build case studies around extreme weather events with immense regional impacts. By using observational data to model conditions related to a key event, researchers can test how well models perform on a regional scale to improve predictive capabilities.
