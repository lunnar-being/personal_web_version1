Award Number: DE-EE0008378CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6, B3.15Fuel Cell Technologies OfficeLocation(s): WVOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to West Virginia University (WVU) to develop an intermediate temperature (T = 600ÂºC) proton-conducting solid oxide electrolysis cell (IT H-SOEC). The cell would include a water-splitting functional layer involving a conformal coating of electro-catalyst/electrolyte matrixes. The project would also seek to identify highly active, triple-conducting electrocatalysts and to develop conformal coating methods for depositing these catalysts into composite anode functional layers.
