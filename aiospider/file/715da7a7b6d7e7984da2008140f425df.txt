Award Number: DE-EE0009077CX(s) Applied: A9, A11Building Technologies OfficeLocation(s): ILOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to Elevate Energy (Elevate) to develop a Chicago residential energy retrofit strategy aligned with City priorities for energy efficiency, energy affordability, resiliency, equity and transparency. With the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) as a partner, Elevate would characterize the housing stock and energy use characteristics using modeling to then develop energy retrofit packages suitable for field validation in single family homes. Field validation could include integration with demand response, battery storage, and/or renewable energy technologies. The project would be completed over three Budget Periods (BPs), with a Go/No-Go Decision Point in between each BP. Only BP1 is being reviewed at this time as the information developed during BP1 would inform and define the activities going forward into BP2. At this time, there is not enough information to complete a review of BP2 and BP3 activities. Once additional details of project technology packages and field validation locations are defined, another NEPA review will be required to assess potential impacts associated with activities in BP2 and BP3.
