Detail

This notice cancels and replaces Notice 998 (November 2017). Details of any changes to the previous version can be found in paragraph 1.2](#what-changed).

This notice explains the VAT rules that apply to those museums and galleries that are eligible for refunds of VAT under section 33A of the VAT Act 1994 and which are listed in the ‘VAT (Refund of Tax to Museums and Galleries) Order’.

1. Overview

1.1 Information in this notice

This notice applies to those museums or galleries that offer free admission to the public and which are eligible for refunds of VAT under the museums and galleries VAT Refund Scheme. Eligible bodies are listed Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax to Museums and Galleries) Order 2001. This is reproduced in the annex to this notice.

1.2 What’s changed

The list of qualifying museums and galleries has been updated.

1.3 Who should read this notice

Museums and galleries eligible for the museums and galleries VAT Refund Scheme.

1.4 The law this notice relates to

The legal provisions concerning this scheme can be found at:


  VAT Act 1994, section 33A, which details the workings of the scheme
  VAT (Refund of Tax to Museums and Galleries) Order 2001 (SI 2001/2879) which lists those museums and galleries eligible for the scheme, and the date from which they became so eligible - see paragraph 1.5


1.5 What the position is for museums or galleries that offer free admission to the public

Museums and galleries offering free access are not regarded as being engaged in any business in relation to this activity. They may, of course, have other activities that in their own right are business activities, for example, catering, sales of books and gifts and exhibitions for which there is a charge.

Ordinarily, it is not possible to recover the VAT incurred on goods and services purchased to support non-business activities. Thus VAT incurred in connection with the free admission of the public is not normally recoverable.

In certain circumstances, however, the government will reimburse this otherwise irrecoverable VAT. For this to be the case, the provisions of section 33A of the VAT Act 1994 (enacted on 1 April 2001) must apply, and the museum or gallery must be named in an order made by HM Treasury.

1.6 What bodies are in section 33A and from when

Bodies eligible to claim refunds of VAT under Section 33A are listed in Column 1 of the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax to Museums and Galleries) Order 2001.

Details of the specific museums and galleries to which such claims relate are set out in Column 2 of the Order.

Museums and galleries are eligible for a refund on or after the 1 April 2001 unless Column 3 of the Order specifies a later date from which a claim can be made.

As an example:

      Column 2: relevant museums and galleries

1.7 Who can be added to section 33A

Section 33A of the VAT Act 1994 is a VAT Refund Scheme aimed at supporting the provision of free access to museums and galleries. Introduced in 2001, the scheme allows eligible museums and galleries to claim back VAT incurred on most goods and services purchased in order to grant free rights of admission to their collections.

From 16 March 2016 the eligibility criteria for the scheme have been broadened. Applications are no longer restricted to national and university museums and galleries only.

There are strict conditions for inclusion in the section 33A scheme and it is not sufficient that a museum or gallery admits the public free of charge.

Requests to include new bodies in the scheme, or to add a new museum or gallery operated by a body already in the scheme, will be considered. Requests must be fully supported by one of the appropriate following administrations or departments.

These are:


  Department for Culture, Media and Sport
  Welsh Assembly Government
  Northern Ireland Assembly
  Scottish Government
  Ministry of Defence


Nominations should be sent in the first instance to the relevant department or administration listed.

The completion of an application does not guarantee admission to the scheme, and the decision on whether to include a museum or gallery in the scheme is ultimately made by ministers.

To be eligible to apply for admission to the scheme museums or galleries must:


  be open to the general public for at least 30 hours per week, without exception
  offer free entry, without prior appointment
  hold collections in a purpose-built building
  display details of free entry and opening hours on the museum website


Newly eligible museums will also be required to complete a strategic business case as part of the application process, including:


  proof of Arts Council England Accredited status (or equivalent)
  past and, or projected visitor figures
  information on existing and planned education programmes and community engagement work


Upon admission to the scheme museums will be required to provide:


  evidence confirming an obligation to providing or continuing to provide free entry
  visitor figures on a bi-annual basis


1.8 How section 33A applies to a library

Section 33A does not extend to libraries. However, the Treasury has extended the scheme to cover permanent collections in the British Library, the National Library of Scotland and the National Library of Wales. This is because these qualify as museum collections. Section 33A does not refund, for example, VAT incurred in relation to the reading rooms. This VAT is subject to the normal rules explained in VAT guide (VAT Notice 700).

1.9 VAT groups and section 33A bodies

Section 33A bodies can form a VAT group if they meet the requirements for VAT group treatment as set out in VAT Notice 700/2: group and divisional registration. HMRC will grant such requests only if it’s satisfied that you’re not seeking the arrangement for tax avoidance purposes.

1.10 Change in circumstances

The Treasury order contains your name and the names and addresses of your museums or galleries that are covered by the refund scheme. Please advise your sponsor department (paragraph 1.7) if any of those details change, or if you revert to charging for public admission. They in turn will contact HMRC.

2. Definition of ‘free admission’

2.1 What this section is about

This section explains what VAT you can reclaim under the scheme. From the date specified in a Treasury order, you will be entitled to recover the VAT you incur in relation to ‘free rights of admission’ which would otherwise be non-recoverable.

2.2 Free admission

Admission is free where the public is able to enter a museum or gallery (without pre-booking), view the collections on display and use freely available facilities for no charge. This includes, for example, access to common areas and facilities such as play areas for children, lectures and instructional classes provided for no charge.

2.3 What VAT can be reclaimed under section 33A

You can reclaim VAT incurred on most goods and services you purchase in order to grant ‘free rights of admission’ to your principal collections. This extends to VAT incurred on:


  the supply to you of goods or services
  goods you have imported into the UK
  goods you acquire in Northern Ireland from the EU


2.4 The supply of goods and services

Whether or not you’re registered for VAT, you can get refunds on goods and services you use or intend to use for free admissions only if you:


  place the order
  receive the supply
  receive a tax invoice addressed to you
  pay from your own funds (including funds awarded to you, for example, lottery funds)


2.5 Time limits for claiming VAT

You must make your claim within 4 years of the due date of your VAT Return for the prescribed accounting period in which the VAT became chargeable - but commencing only from the date specified in the Treasury order naming you.


  
    
      Column 1: body
      Column 2: relevant museums and galleries
      Column 3: effective date if after 1 April 2001

      County and postcode
       
    
  


If ‘New building’ incurs VAT on goods or services that is attributable to the provision of free rights of admission (see paragraph 2.6), and this VAT is incurred on or after 1 August 2014, the museum has a period of 4 years forward from that date to make a claim for this VAT.

2.6 What we mean by VAT incurred in relation to ‘free rights of admission’

Where you admit the public free of charge to view the principal collections in your museum or gallery, you will be able to reclaim the VAT you have incurred on the:


  items and collections on display (provided they have borne VAT)
  goods and services necessary for their upkeep
  upkeep of the part of the building (including common areas) in which they’re housed
  provision of free information in relation to the items or collections on display, including advertising and other promotional material


2.7 Specific examples

More specifically, this might include the VAT you incur in relation to:


  buying, acquiring or importing the items and collections to which the public has free access
  storing, cleaning and restoring them
  repairing and maintaining that part of the museum or gallery where they’re housed, including cleaning that area and making it secure
  building a new wing to house them
  providing ‘virtual’ access to, and information about them, including virtual museum tours via your free website (provided this is not a business activity)
  providing free lectures
  advertising and promoting them by any other means, including the internet


It also includes those areas, such as office space, that are not themselves open to the public but which are used for administration purposes in connection with free admissions.

2.8 How section 33A applies if you charge the public to see specific items or exhibitions

Provided the public has free access to the principal collections on display, it does not matter that you occasionally charge people to see special exhibitions and so on. However, your claim under section 33A is restricted to VAT incurred in relation to ‘free rights of admission’ as explained in paragraphs 2.2 to 2.6. VAT incurred in relation to the special exhibition the public pays to see is subject to the normal rules of input tax deduction, see VAT guide (VAT Notice 700).

2.9 When VAT cannot be claimed under section 33A

The provisions in section 33A cannot be used to reclaim any VAT you incur in relation to:


  any non-business activities other than providing free admission to the public (see paragraph 2.2) - for example, you cannot recover under this provision any VAT incurred in relation to grant funded research
  any business activities, such as shops, catering outlets, commercial sponsorship (including commercially sponsored websites), or educational courses that you provide for consideration


Additionally, section 33A does not permit you to recover any VAT:


  that cannot be recovered under the normal VAT rules - see VAT guide (VAT Notice 700)

  incurred in another country - in certain circumstances you can reclaim this VAT from the authorities in the country where you incurred the VAT – see Claim back VAT incurred in the UK if you’re established elsewhere (VAT Notice 723A)



2.10 The VAT you’re entitled to recover

The provisions in section 33A cannot be used to recover VAT incurred in any circumstance other than those outlined in paragraphs 2.2 to 2.8.

But, if you’re registered for VAT you can recover the VAT incurred on the supply to you of most goods and services, and the importation or acquisition by you of most goods, that relate to your taxable business activities. See VAT guide (VAT Notice 700).

You cannot generally recover VAT incurred in relation to supplies you make that are exempt from VAT, and you’ll need to operate a partial exemption method to determine whether, and how much, input tax will be restricted. The VAT guide and Partial exemption (VAT Notice 706) give further details.

If you are not registered for VAT, you cannot reclaim any VAT other than to the extent that this is permitted under section 33A.

2.11 Effect on input tax you’ve recovered from charging when you no longer charge the public for admission to museums or galleries

Museums and galleries listed in the Order are not required to account for VAT on goods and services on which they properly recovered input tax and subsequently used to offer free rights of admission. This makes sure that input tax properly recovered at the time on a capital item, as defined in the Capital Goods Scheme, is not made subject to adjustments under that scheme solely on account of the move to free admission. Further information can be found in Extra Statutory Concession (ESC) 3.34 in VAT Notice 48: extra statutory concessions.

2.12 The effect of the VAT on the stock and capital assets on hand when your registration for VAT is cancelled

There are certain circumstances when you will have to account for tax on your business assets on hand at deregistration. These are explained in VAT Notice 700/11: cancelling your registration. However, any assets that you use solely for the purpose of admitting the public free of charge to your principal collections are no longer the assets of a business, and you do not have to account for tax on these assets at the point of deregistration.

3. Recovering the VAT you’ve incurred on the free right of admission

3.1 What this section is about

This section explains how you can recover the VAT you’ve incurred in providing free admission under section 33A of the VAT Act 1994.

3.2 How VAT refunds are claimed after you’ve registered for VAT

You should claim your refund in box 4 of the VAT Return. In that box you should include not only the value of the input tax you incurred in making your taxable business supplies, but also the amount of VAT you’re reclaiming under section 33A on those goods and services you have bought for right of free admission. Be sure to include the net value of your claim in box 7.

3.3 How VAT refunds are claimed if you are not registered for VAT

If you are not registered for VAT and you do not need to register, you should read section 4. You will still be able to claim a refund of the VAT you have incurred on the goods and services you have bought for your free admission activities.

3.4 How to make a claim

You must:


  make the claim in writing
  state the amount you are claiming
  state the periods covered
  explain the basis of your calculation
  hold evidence to support your claim


4. Museums and galleries not registered for VAT

4.1 What this section is about

If you’re a museum or gallery in section 33A of the VAT Act 1994 and you are not registered for VAT, this section will help you make sure your claims for VAT refunds are valid. It also explains how to make them.
