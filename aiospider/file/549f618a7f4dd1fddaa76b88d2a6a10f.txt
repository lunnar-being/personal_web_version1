          Details


          

    
            
Ofsted’s routine inspections were suspended in March 2020 because of COVID-19 (coronavirus). From April 2021 we will introduce routine focused visits as part of a phased return to routine inspection.

Unless otherwise specified in the routine focused visits guidance, Ofsted inspectors will follow the main Cafcass inspection framework. This applies from 1 April 2021.

The inspection framework sets out how Ofsted will inspect the quality and effectiveness of Cafcass’s private and public law practice with children and families and the impact of leaders on private and public law practice with children and families. In evaluating the impact of the service, the inspection will also evaluate how well Cafcass positively influences the effectiveness of the family justice system both locally and nationally. We ran a consultation on the framework between October and November 2020.
