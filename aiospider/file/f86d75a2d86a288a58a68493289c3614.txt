Award Number: DE-EE0009295CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6, B5.25Bioenergy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): CAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to University of California San Diego (UCSD) to develop novel algae-based organic compounds for use in the production of polyurethane (PU) products. These would include algae based diisocyanates and polyols. The compounds would be developed so as to increase the organic content of PUs and enhance PU product performance. Test batches of the compounds would be synthesized, characterized, and assessed for biodegradation performance.
