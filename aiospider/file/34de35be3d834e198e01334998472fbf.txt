BAE Systems AI Labs was commissioned by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) to review the state of the art techniques in generating privacy-preserving synthetic data. Driven primarily by the need for sharing sensitive data for research and development purposes, synthetically generated data should preserve the characteristics of real data while protecting the personal or sensitive information present in the original data.
