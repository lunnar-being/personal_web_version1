Graduates of historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) climb the economic ladder at rates well above those of their non-HBCU-graduate peers. HBCU graduates are 51 percent more likely to move into a higher-income quintile than graduates of non-HBCUs. Moreover, the economic mobility rate for HBCUs is nearly double that of all US colleges.
