US mortgage-servicing businesses are experiencing significant industry-wide challenges as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, driven by surging unemployment, an exponential increase in customer forbearance requests, and an impending surge in delinquencies and losses. As a result, servicers need to rapidly build and operationalize their readiness plans for the next 6 to 12 months to support a significant number of distressed borrowers and ensure operational readiness for a vastly different landscape. In this article, we briefly discuss the expected magnitude of the borrower and industry impact based on our recent customer insights and industry roundtable, and discuss the dimensions of a holistic readiness plan for servicers.The significant macroeconomic stresses exerted by COVID-19—for example, peak unemployment rates exceeding the 10 percent levels observed in 2009 (Exhibit 1)—are expected to result in a significant surge in delinquencies and losses in 2020-2021 and beyond. Results from our weekly consumer pulse check survey and responses from mortgage-servicing executives during our recent roundtable indicate that about 10 to 12 percent of mortgages may end up in forbearance, with 20 percent or more of these potentially progressing to default and requiring assistance (Exhibit 2). This means that more than one million customers may need assistance over the next 12 to 36 months. As a point of comparison, currently the industry processes about 45,000 loan modifications per quarter. The sheer magnitude of the resulting customer assistance needs requires immediate and swift action by servicers to build readiness before expiry of the forbearance period.There are several lessons to take from the impact of the 2008 financial crisis, and servicers can use capabilities developed in response to that crisis to bolster their downturn readiness in the current environment. However, a “rinse and repeat” of the 2008 toolkit is unlikely to be effective, given that the triggers and nature of this crisis are unique and distinct from 2008. These include:While servicers developed capabilities in the previous downturn that can be leveraged today (e.g., HAMP, HAFA, SPOC), an expanded set of capabilities are now available to help customers in distress, such as sophisticated risk analytics (e.g., using external data, artificial intelligence and machine-learning models) and digital tools (e.g., self-service, robotics, outreach through digital channels).Finally, there is significant evolution in regulatory perception, with financial institutions playing a central role in current recovery efforts.Servicers must work with customers to get ahead of the potential losses stemming from distress due to the crisis and slow the surge of distressed loans in the future. Simultaneously, servicers must also rapidly build operational readiness in preparation for the significant surge in delinquencies expected in the coming months.Doing this right will require an end-to-end approach across the default management value chain, and targeted action in five areas: digital and self-serve, streamlining loss-mitigation operations, addressing capacity shortfalls, portfolio risk segmentation and analytics, and the development of a robust centralized “nerve center” program management capability. Servicers will need to consider dependencies across these areas, and can pursue selective partnerships to accelerate impact (e.g., for capacity, digital and analytics).While servicers have focused their crisis response over the last three months on capacity shortfall, liquidity concerns (especially for non-banks), and gearing up collections/loss-mitigation operations, there are five major priorities that will require critical focus going forward (Exhibit 3).Time is of the essence. Mortgage servicing executives can use a set of key questions to help them shape their near-term action plan and ensure readiness to support significantly higher numbers of borrowers in their time of need:
