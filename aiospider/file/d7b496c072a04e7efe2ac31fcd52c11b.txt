          Details


          

    
            
The register is based at Public Health England in London.

A multidisciplinary team, under the guidance of an expert steering group, undertakes the work of the register.

The register contains data for one of the largest cohorts of patients in Europe who have acquired their hepatitis C infections on a known date. Most cases are transfusion recipients who were traced during the national HCV lookback programme.

Systematic collection of clinical data using standardised report forms allows us to gather data consistently about every 3-5 years. These data, along with linked mortality and cancer data for cases and controls, allow us to establish the clinical course of HCV infection, and investigate risk factors for progressive disease.

Ongoing recruitment of paediatric and other HCV infections with known dates of acquisition enables us to inform and compare the clinical course of HCV infection in other important patient groups.
