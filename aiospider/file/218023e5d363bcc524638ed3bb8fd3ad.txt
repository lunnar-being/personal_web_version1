We are proud to highlight the following young political appointees working to advance the President’s agenda. Responses have been edited for clarity and length.





U.S. General Services Administration










Roberto Rosas, 
Policy Advisor in the Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs





1. In a couple sentences, what do you do?





As a Policy Advisor, I work to connect our agency with Congress and across different levels of government on public policy matters. Our partnership with these stakeholders focuses on our shared interests of serving the American people through the mission-support services of the General Services Administration (GSA) like public real estate, technology, and acquisitions.





2. What is your favorite part of your job?





My favorite part of my job is working with fellow hard-working public servants on cost-effective, sustainable public infrastructure projects. Smart stewardship is at the heart of GSA. It is best reflected in this concise description of GSA’s modus operandi: 
business mind, service heart.





3. What personal experiences have shaped the way you approach your work?





Growing up as an American of Mexican descent meant developing a collaborative, multicultural spirit which I bring with me to my work at GSA. In addition to serving federal agencies, we engage with state, local, territorial, and tribal governments with a diversity-enriched mindset that helps us connect with others in a more inclusive, understanding way. Fostering this collaborative outlook, we can better provide real estate, technology, and procurement solutions to our client agencies in order to support their missions.





U.S. Department of health and human services










Sabrina Bousbar, 
Special Assistant to the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response





1. In a couple sentences, what do you do?





I currently serve as the Special Assistant to the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) Dawn O’Connell. A lot of our work has been around COVID-19 response, but we have also played a role in aiding Afghan refugees, those affected by natural disasters, and more. My job is to help the ASPR through coordinating travel, memos, projects, and schedules, and doing anything else needed to help her and the Department succeed.





2. What is your favorite part of your job?





The team and purpose behind our office is my absolute favorite. Everyone is so dedicated, passionate, and open-minded in everything that they do. Throughout the emergencies, it is important to have a great work environment, and being a part of this amazing team has made my experience absolutely worthwhile.





3. What personal experiences have shaped the way you approach your work?





My mother is from Colombia, and my father is from Morocco. Growing up in an immigrant household as a first-generation American, there were many personal experiences that shaped my thoughts and approaches to life. From traveling to visit family to learning different cultures and languages to receiving a dual certificate in Social Justice and Emergency Management & Homeland Security at Florida State University, I am always thinking about diversity, equity, and inclusion in my work. I believe it is important to bring our personal experiences to the table in order to help our communities and future generations.

, 
Special Assistant in the Office of Refugee Resettlement





1. In a couple sentences, what do you do?





I am the Special Assistant in the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), which helps new populations maximize their potential in the United States by linking them to critical resources that assist them in becoming integrated members of American society. I provide direct support to the Director and Chief of Staff of ORR.





2. What is your favorite part of your job?





My favorite part of the job is working with people who are passionate about the mission of ORR and are dedicated to the welfare of the populations that we serve. For many of the people that we serve, we are their first introduction to the United States, and there is a lot of pride and pressure to that.





3. What personal experiences have shaped the way you approach your work?





Growing up in an immigrant family, I saw firsthand how difficult living in a new country could be. This has helped me approach our work to serve others with compassion and dedication.





U.S. Department of Labor










L
auren Reyes, 
Deputy White House Liaison





1. In a couple sentences, what do you do?





As Deputy White House Liaison, my job has two equally important parts. One part is serving as a liaison between the Department, the White House, and the Presidential Personnel Office, assisting the White House Liaison in creating and relaying documents that reflect the points of view of the Department and the Administration. The other component is serving as a direct agent for the Department: building and supporting the Department by creating structures, providing training and development to political appointees, and overseeing and encouraging a positive and supportive team culture.





2. What is your favorite part of your job?





I love supporting fellow appointees and serving as a resource for people within the Department and throughout the Administration. I particularly enjoy working with our Special Assistants. On a monthly basis, I hold a “Special Assistant Brainstorm” session during which I provide professional development trainings to make sure they are set up for success in their current role and as they grow. These conversations are so uplifting and really highlight the passion our political appointees have for this Administration.





3. What personal experiences have shaped the way you approach your work?





From being raised by a single mom to bearing the weight of my dad’s immigration status, my life has been a lesson in serving others. My dad is an immigrant from Mexico who faced many struggles coming to the United States; even once he was here, he was not safe from removal proceedings. This personal struggle and the years we worked to find a solution inspired me to help other people feel safe and valued. Whether I was volunteering for non-profits during law school, serving at a legal aid society, or working on campaigns, I have always wanted to provide a voice for the underserved and underrepresented.





In 2018, I was a sponsor for my dad when a judge was able to see the sacrifices and the successes of a man looking for a better life, and today, my dad is a legal permanent resident of the United States. While my family is fortunate to have made it through that rough patch, I will always remember my fear when a court date was set and how that fear continues to be all too real for so many others. Our jobs and the quality of our work within the Administration will directly impact the personal experiences of so many people, and our mission is to have a positive impact on people’s lives.





White House Office of Management and Budget










I
sabel Aldunate
, 
Deputy Associate Director for Communications





1. In a couple sentences, what do you do?





I am the Deputy Associate Director for Communications for the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB). That means I handle the press and strategic communications for anything having to do with the management side of the federal government.





2. What is your favorite part of your job?





My favorite part of my job is how diverse my portfolio is. The management side of OMB is truly all encompassing. I get to work on really cool topics including cybersecurity, tech policy, Made-in-America policy, and more.





3. What personal experiences have shaped the way you approach your work?





I’m the daughter of an immigrant (my father is from Bolivia), and being a first-generation American on my father’s side has taught me the values and work ethic that I approach my work with. My father immigrated to the United States to provide his children with opportunities that were not available in Bolivia – knowing that, I do not take anything for granted.










D
rew Rodriguez
,
 
Confidential Assistant to the Federal Chief Information Officer and the Federal Chief Information Security Officer





1. In a couple sentences, what do you do?





I am the Confidential Assistant to the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO), Clare Martorana, and the Federal Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Chris DeRusha. I help organize and manage Clare and Chris’s daily functions. Whether setting up meetings with other departments, acting as a liaison with speaking engagement hosts, or organizing their briefing materials, I hope to set them up for success each and every day.





2. What is your favorite part of your job?





My favorite part is witnessing the behind the scenes of the policymaking process. Many executive orders are drafted in OMB and require input from many different offices and entities. As the Confidential Assistant to the CIO and CISO, I’m often one of the first points of contact between our office and other departments in the Administration. It’s been extremely rewarding to help coordinate these efforts and maintain timeliness, while witnessing the full scope of work involved in this process. It is inspiring seeing so many thoughtful and hardworking administration officials work towards making effective policies that will improve the lives of the American people.





3. What personal experiences have shaped the way you approach your work?





My work approach is definitely influenced by observing my mom’s work ethic throughout my childhood. My mom had me during her senior year in high school. As a single mom, there were times she worked three jobs simultaneously to raise and provide for me and my younger brothers, all while bringing unrivaled commitment, passion, and positivity to her work and everyone she met. Not only is she the hardest working person I know, but she also cares deeply for others. She taught me how important working hard and helping others are to finding success in America – particularly for those struggling the most.
