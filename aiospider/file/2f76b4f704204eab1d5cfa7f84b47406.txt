          What has changed since EU Exit:

Working on Horizon Europe funded projects.

Q&A on the UK’s participation in Horizon Europe.

Who it’s for

To apply for most Horizon Europe funding, you must be a consortium. Usually, the consortium must be made up of at least 3 organisations from different countries.

Get in touch with your UK national contact point for advice on:


  how to form a consortium
  how to apply for Horizon Europe funding


What you can get funding for

You may be able to get Horizon Europe funding for projects which:


  involve ground breaking research or new technologies
  improve research training and development, or research infrastructure
  create growth in sectors like advanced manufacturing, materials, biotechnology, information and communication technology, nanotechnology and space
  increase private investment in research
  respond to challenges like climate change, food security or healthcare for an ageing population


Small or medium sized companies (SMEs) can also get help from a coach or mentor, eg to improve management skills, create a marketing strategy or raise finance.
