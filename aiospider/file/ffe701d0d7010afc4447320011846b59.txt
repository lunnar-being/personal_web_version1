Almost all financial decision makers in Australia view the current economy as neutral or weak and most expect it to remain the same or weaken in the next three months. 44 percent of consumers are concerned or somewhat concerned about their job security, down from 50 percent in April. Roughly 42 percent of consumers claim to only have four months or fewer in savings to live off, an improvement of 9 percentage points since June. The majority of consumers feel banks are performing per their expectations and would like them to waive late fees and reduce minimum payments on credit cards. Contactless payments have seen increased usage over the past month, while cash and cheque usage has decreased.
