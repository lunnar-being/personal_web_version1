Award Number: DE-EE0009253CX(s) Applied: A9, A11, B3.6Fuel Cell Technologies OfficeLocation(s): CAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to Electric Power Research Institute, Inc. (EPRI) to develop and train a workforce for the emerging hydrogen technology industry. EPRI would form a team for developing and delivering professional training, curriculum materials, and educational offerings at various levels. Coursework and educational materials developed by EPRI and its project partners (Oregon State University, Purdue University, University of Delaware, and GTI) would be dispersed to universities, community colleges, and technical schools. Curriculum would focus on workshops and other educational assemblies, university curricula in hydrogen science and engineering fundamentals, and professional training courses. University of Delaware would incorporate a hands-on laboratory module to educate students about the design, assembly, and testing of fuel cells. No manufacturing, construction, field testing, or facility modification are expected under this award. Curriculum development would consist exclusively of intellectual, academic, or analytical activities such as information gathering, data analysis, and data dissemination.
