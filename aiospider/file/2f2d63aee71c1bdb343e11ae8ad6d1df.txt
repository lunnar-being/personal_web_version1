Program
 The recent advances made within the realm of Artificial Intelligence have sparked widespread debate around the frameworks for its regulation. As such, its varied applications have raised several pertinent questions related to the long-term implications and ethical considerations for its use globally. And while several different approaches to its regulation have been proposed and implemented across different geographies and political systems, an important consideration still remains - that of the role of inter-governmental agencies; specifically, the United Nations.

Join us for an in-depth discussion with Prateek Sibal, moderated by Osonde Osoba, on the role of a specialized UN agency, UNESCO, in the governance of AI. The conversation will sketch the goals, tools, and limitations of its role, while exploring the role of the government and other public and private actors in AI's regulation and long-term use.
