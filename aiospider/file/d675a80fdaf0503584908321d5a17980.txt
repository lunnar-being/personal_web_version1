This overview of the UK’s existing regulatory framework for radiological and civil nuclear safety outlines the work of 11 government departments and 16 regulatory bodies across the UK.

It covers 7 broad themes:


  occupational exposures
  civil nuclear safety
  public exposures and environmental protection
  medical and non-medical exposures
  consumer products and radiation
  transport of radioactive material
  emergency preparedness and response


It also sets out how we maintain our safety framework and demonstrate regulatory transparency. A summary of the UK’s policies on radiological and civil nuclear safety is set out in chapter 2.
