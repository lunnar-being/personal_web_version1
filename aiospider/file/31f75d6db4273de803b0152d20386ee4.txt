McKinseyâ€™s eighth COVID-19-focused consumer health survey, conducted October 26, 2020, provides an updated view of consumer health-related experiences and perceptions. Many consumers said they are open to receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, although more than a third expressed concern about side effects. Anxiety and distress continue to be major factors for Americans, especially if they have had or know someone who has had COVID-19. The majority of respondents said that they remain committed to wearing a face mask, social distancing, and limiting time in public places if that is the recommended guidance over the next six months, and two-thirds said they would work from home at least some of the time if advised.
