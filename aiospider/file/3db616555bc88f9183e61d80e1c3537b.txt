Yesterday, the  (DOE), in partnership with the Clean Energy Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute (CESMII), announced a $4.8 million request for proposals (RFP) to develop emerging technologies for the manufacturing sector, including advanced sensors, cloud-based computing, advanced modeling and simulation, and artificial intelligence. These smart manufacturing technologies will improve the productivity and operating efficiency of the manufacturing sector, reduce waste and move the country towards President Biden’s goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.“Smart manufacturing technologies will play a vital role in decarbonizing the entire lifecycle of manufactured goods,”  “These technologies can help us build new, integrated systems that increase energy productivity and revitalize American manufacturing.”The RFP will focus on addressing challenges in sensing, control, analytics and predictive modeling technologies. The RFP also solicits ideas for college and university outreach and training strategies that will expand and diversify the clean-manufacturing workforce.Proposal submissions are due by August 3, 2021. View the request for proposals .Founded in 2016, CESMII accelerates smart manufacturing adoption through the integration of advanced sensors, data analytics, platforms and controls. It is the third institute funded by EERE's . CESMII is also a part of ®, a network of federally funded institutes that have a specialized technology focus to increase U.S. manufacturing competitiveness and promote a robust and sustainable national manufacturing R&D infrastructure.
