          Details


          

    
            
The Defence and Security Accelerator (DASA) and Defence Equipment and Support (DE&S) are seeking innovative technologies to enable Unmanned Air Systems (UAS) that will deliver tactical advantage and reduce threat to life for service personnel conducting operations in urban environments.

This collaboration between DASA and DE&S is designed for the rapid exploitation of technology and is the first of its kind. Since this differs from previous DASA calls, please read the contents of this document carefully to ensure you understand the process for applying.

To be considered for inclusion on the framework, tenderers must first complete the compulsory Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ) and Cyber Risk Assessment questionnaire, by Thursday 15 October at midday BST. Tenderers who pass both the PQQ and Cyber Risk Assessment will then be sent an Invitation To Tender (ITT) to get onto the framework.

For information purposes only, details of the specific requirements of each Phase are contained within this document. We are not accepting proposals for either of the Phases during this pre-qualification stage.
