Modern slavery is a harmful and hidden crime and its victims may be especially isolated and hidden from view during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.

Help and support is available for victims of modern slavery. This guidance sets out what modern slavery is, how to recognise the indicators of modern slavery and how to refer suspected cases of modern slavery to the appropriate services.
