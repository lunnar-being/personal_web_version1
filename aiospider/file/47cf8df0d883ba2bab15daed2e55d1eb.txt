The Eliza by Doro, is a smart alarm system that enables people to feel secure at home and enjoy their lives safely and independently. In the current environment many vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with disabilities, are at home and isolated from caregivers and kin. This device provides an opportunity for additional safety in a distanced world. Our team focused on making the buttons user-friendly and simple. Acclaimed for its cutting-edge aesthetic, which earned it a 2020 iF Design Award and a Fast Company Innovation by Design honor, the Doro Eliza truly raises the bar in the industry.
