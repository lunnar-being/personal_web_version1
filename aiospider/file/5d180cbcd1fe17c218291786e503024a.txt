U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) researchers have won 38 of the 100 awards given out this year by R&D World. The annual R&D 100 Awards are given in recognition of exceptional technologies developed during the previous year. The awards were announced in three separate virtual events on September 29 and 30 and October 1, 2020.“The Department of Energy and its National Laboratories and sites were born out of the spirit of innovation, an all-American trait that we strive to carry on today,” said Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette. “We are extremely proud to recognize our 2020 R&D 100 award winners for their contributions to the development of important new technologies that improve our lives and help keep America competitive and secure.”Since 1962, when the annual competition began, DOE’s National Laboratories and many sites have received more than 900 R&D 100 awards. The awards are selected by an independent panel of judges based on the technical significance, uniqueness, and usefulness of projects and technologies from across industry, government, and academia.“The annual R&D 100 Awards acknowledge research and innovation that can affect and improve the daily lives of Americans,” said Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Daniel R Simmons. “I am proud of the work we and our partners are doing to advance transformational technologies and ensure an affordable, efficient, and secure energy future in the United States.”Many of these projects were developed in collaboration with private companies or academic institutions. Several projects engaged multiple National Laboratories. Of the 38 awards won by DOE National Laboratory researchers, 10 were awarded for Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) technologies. Additionally, EERE’s Better Building partners—who are not a part of the DOE National Laboratory complex—were also recognized.A complete list of winners can be found at .
