​The National Model Design Code sets out clear design parameters to help local authorities and communities decide what good quality design looks like in their area.

The National Model Design Code forms part of the government’s planning practice guidance and expands on the ten characteristics of good design set out in the National design guide, which reflects the government’s priorities and provides a common overarching framework for design.
