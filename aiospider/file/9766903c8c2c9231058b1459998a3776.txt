Award Number: DE-EE0008930CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Bioenergy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): MAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to University of Massachusetts Lowell (UMass) to develop a biochemical conversion process for recycling poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film and fibers commonly found in post-consumer and industrial waste streams. UMass proposes a three-step recycling process which would involve mechanical pretreatment, enzymatic polymer deconstruction with integrated ball-milling, and microbial bioconversion. Step one and two of this process would be completed by UMass. Step three would be completed at the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) in Golden, Colorado.
