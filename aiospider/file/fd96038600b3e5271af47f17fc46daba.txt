The Serious Violence Duty in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill 2021 will require local partnerships to complete a strategic needs assessment to understand how violence is affecting their communities and to help them develop a response strategy.

This guidance explains the framework and component parts of a serious violence strategic needs assessment, as well as how to use data to inform your results and recommendations.

The strategic needs assessment process will involve a wide range of partners and stakeholders, including:


  local authorities
  the police
  the fire service
  criminal justice agencies
  health authorities
  children’s services and education
  the voluntary sector
  the local community


You should read this guidance alongside the Home Office’s Serious Violence Duty: draft guidance.
