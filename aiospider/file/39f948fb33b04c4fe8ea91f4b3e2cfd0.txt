Award Number: DE-EE0008817CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6, B5.22Fuel Cell Technologies OfficeLocation(s): CAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to Electricore, Inc. for the design, development, fabrication, and testing of a dispenser and nozzle assembly (nozzle, receptacle, hose, and breakaway) capable of fueling heavy-duty (HD) vehicles to help enable wide-scale hydrogen production, delivery, storage, and use across the HD vehicle sector. Project activities (administration, management, design, engineering, manufacturing, and testing) would occur within the offices of Electricore (California) and Quong & Associates (California), as well as at the facilities of Bennett Pump Company (Michigan), WEH Technologies (Texas), WEH GmbH headquarters (Germany), and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Colorado. Field demonstration of the dispenser and nozzle assembly would occur at a site that has yet to be determined. The project would be completed over two Budget Periods (BPs), with a Go/No-Go Decision Point in between the BPs.
