This accessible forms and surveys statement applies to online forms and surveys published on GOV.UK by the:


  Department for Transport (DfT)
  Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CCAV)
  Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC)
  Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (OZEV)


It covers forms, surveys and other types of services completed online.

It doesn’t cover content published on GOV.UK as:


  documents (PDFs, spreadsheets, presentations etc) – the DfT accessible document policy covers these
  webpages (HTML) – the main GOV.UK accessibility statement covers these


This statement tells you how accessible these online forms and surveys are, how they were tested, and how to report any accessibility problems you have using them.
