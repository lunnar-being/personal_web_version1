Introduction

Section 251 is part of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009.

Local authorities submit statements on planned and actual expenditure on education and children’s social care.

The Department for Education uses the data for publishing statistics, constructing benchmarking tables, answering parliamentary questions and responding to other data requests.

Comparing information is important for schools forums and others in discussions about budget levels and use of funds.

Budget guidance


Local authorities do not need to submit a section 251 budget statement for 2020 to 2021.


This is to help reduce the burden on educational and care settings so you can focus on the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19).  You can view the full list of data collection changes for the remainder of the academic year.

Read the section 251 budget guide for local authorities 2020 to 2021 (PDF, 1.03 MB, 69 pages) to find out how local authorities record their budget statements.

The administrative direction (PDF, 139 KB, 2 pages) is a formal request for the collection of section 251 data. It’s prepared on behalf of the Secretary of State for Education.

Section 251 outturn

Read section 251 guidance for local authorities compiling their 2020 to 2021 outturn statement (PDF, 538 KB, 57 pages) to find out how to complete the outturn statement.

The 2020 to 2021 S251 outturn administrative direction  (MS Word Document, 61.9 KB) is the formal request prepared on behalf of the Secretary of State for Education.
