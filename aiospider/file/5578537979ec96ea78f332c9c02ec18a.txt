The Commercial Building Research Infrastructure (funded in part by CBI) was built to develop and validate GEB technologies. The infrastructure provides a platform for researchers to use up to three commercial buildings for isolated or combined experiments. The infrastructure is designed to easily accept the installation of physical building technologies and control systems while providing the ability to integrate that hardware into complex simulation software to enable hardware-in-the-loop experimentation.Stephanie Johnson and Grant Wheeler.

Together these three infrastructures provide an ideal location to develop and validate GEB technologies, allowing for research focusing on commercial building loads, storage, and electric vehicles.This AOP also funded the development of a dynamic commercial rooftop unit testbed. Compared to typical psychrometric or environmental chambers, this testbed was specifically designed for dynamic and realistic control of an RTU. For example, this RTU can use its economizer to condition based on its control algorithms. This testbed was built leveraging previously installed NREL infrastructure providing a unique experimental capability for GEB HVAC technologies.
