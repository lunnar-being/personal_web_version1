Award Number: DE-EE0009378CX(s) Applied: A9, A11, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): NCOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) to develop improved material, welding, and design specification guidance of nickel-based alloy to avoid stress relief cracking in the use of concentrated solar power technologies. The project would aim to understand the root cause(s) of cracking based on recent industrial experience, develop a laboratory test method to identify the variables which are leading to cracking, and utilize the combination of experience and laboratory work to provide improved welding and fabrication guidance. A new industry specification would be produced, which can be directly implemented by end-users of this nickel-based alloy.
