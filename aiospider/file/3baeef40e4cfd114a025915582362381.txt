Award Number: DE-EE0008903CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6, B5.15Bioenergy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): CAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Global Algae Innovations (GAI) to research and develop algae cultivation methods and monitoring tools in order to increase productivity and improve targeted characteristics (e.g. robustness, biomass quality). In terms of cultivation research, GAI would study the effects of alterations to the abiotic conditions of cultivation systems. Laboratory research would focus on developing new analytical testing techniques to improve strain monitoring capabilities and pond management practices.
