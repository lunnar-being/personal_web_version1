At 1:25 a.m. on Monday, February 15, 2021, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) issued a level-three Emergency Energy Alert, meaning energy demand was very high, and conservation was critical. By noon, more than 4.3 million homes and businesses across the state were without power (around 34 percent of total customers) and around 26 percent remained wholly without power or with “rolling” availability—systematic temporary power outages—until Wednesday.These events occurred during a polar vortex, which brought temperatures in Texas to lows not seen in more than 30 years and led Governor Abbott to issue a disaster declaration in all 254 counties. The results were catastrophic. To put the scale of the crisis into perspective, the International Energy Agency said that the level of power outages in Texas was more than 500 times higher than the outages in California in August 2020, and it’s been reported that more than 80 people have lost their lives.Although the implications of this event are still evolving, enough information has emerged to start to piece together precisely what happened to the generation system. More information is emerging every day, and we will provide additional insights regarding implications for the transmission and distribution system and retail market in subsequent articles.That said, this article addresses the following key observations:What follows is a fact-based account of what happened during those critical few days, based on the currently available data and insights (at the time of publication), as well as a series of questions that should be addressed coming out of the crisis.In November 2020, ERCOT published their Winter 2020/2021 Seasonal Assessment and Resource Adequacy (SARA) report,  which outlined seasonal forecasts regarding supply and demand for the power grid.These forecasts included a view on expected capacity (adjusted “firm” capacity and various outage scenarios) and anticipated peak demand. And while ERCOT’s extreme winter weather scenario peak planned up to 67 GW of demand, actual demand during the polar vortex peaked on the evening of February 14 at 69 GW—and could have been as high as 75 GW on February 15 if supply had been available to meet demand (Exhibit 1).Outages were expected to be as high as 13.9 GW in an extreme-outage scenario, leaving 68.6 GW of available capacity to meet peak demand of 67.2 GW (a reserve of 1.4 GW, or approximately 2 percent of total demand). However, during the crisis, approximately 30 GW of thermal generation was not available (more than two times the amount in the extreme-generation outage scenario). This was due to a combination of factors, such as equipment or instrumentation freezing and fuel availability—particularly gas constrained by frozen infrastructure and gas diverted to priority heating loads (Exhibit 2).Wind assets were also pushed offline due to the cold. ERCOT’s extreme-low-wind planning scenario included contributions of 1.8 GW from wind against a base expectation of 7.1 GW. As a result, through much of the week of February 15, there was an overall gap of approximately 15 to 30 GW between expected (“day-ahead”) power demand and generating supply.At the same time (and signaling the depth of the challenge), ERCOT’s wholesale market clearing price hit the administrative cap of $9,000/MWh for 90 out of 120 hours, which is 300 to 400 times the average February price of $21 to $27/MWh. It is worth noting that ERCOT’s market was already experiencing very high pricing ($500 to $5,000/MWh) on February 13 and 14, thereby indicating that supply and demand reserves were already tightening because of the cold weather.While all power-generation sources are being scrutinized following this incident, the two areas receiving the most attention are wind and gas.As of February, ERCOT had 7.1 GW of adjusted firm capacity (8.6 percent of total adjusted firm capacity). Throughout the crisis, ERCOT’s wind output consistently fell below the 7.1 GW firm-capacity plan (Exhibit 3). However, for only 11 out of 120 hours (9 percent of the crisis), wind dropped below ERCOT’s extreme-low-wind-output scenario of 1.8 GW for an average of 3.9 GW (with a difference of 3.2 GW between the base scenario and actual supply). These outages are widely attributed to wind turbines freezing, as they lack heating technology that other onshore wind-generation facilities have in consistently colder climates, such as the Upper Midwest of the United States.Thermal-generator outages due to cold weather remained at more than 30 GW for most of the crisis, significantly higher than the extreme-generator-outage-planning level of 13.9 GW. These outages were caused by a combination of both on-site issues and fuel availability. And while additional data regarding the source of these outages and root cause(s) are being collected, our analysis shows that even if all power-generation facilities were weatherized and fully operational, they likely would not have been able to source gas adequately without having to further curtail other vital residential and commercial end uses.Using February 7 as a baseline, the gas supply in Texas on February 15 fell by approximately 56 percent—from 44.5 to 19.4 bcfd—because of freeze-offs (when cold weather disrupts gas production) and other winter disruptions (Exhibit 4). In fact, 40 percent of production losses occurred in Texas (6 bcfd from the Permian Basin and 3 bcfd from others). Meanwhile, increased demand and freeze-offs in nearby basins and pipelines disrupted imports from other states, and frozen storage facilities stalled withdrawals at approximately 5.0 bcfd until Thursday, February 18 when withdrawals hit record levels of around 16.5 bcfd.Looking at demand sources and factoring in critical end uses, we see that gas supply would likely not have met demand even if all facilities were operating. Furthermore, it’s likely that no other fuel sources were available to balance out gas, as LNG feedgas reached near zero, and exports to Mexico were cut by a third. Thus, while much of the focus has been on potential reforms to the power-generation ecosystem, additional questions should be asked about gas supply.In August 2011, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) jointly published a report looking at the outages that occurred in Texas earlier that winter. Included in the report were a number of recommendations for the electric industry and the natural-gas system, such as incorporating more extreme weather events into planning scenarios, anticipating the so-called next horizon of demand response, developing stronger interconnect tie-ins, and creating incentives or mandates to weatherize facilities.On this last point, electric-power generators were advised to weatherize plants to perform at the lowest recorded ambient temperature for the nearest city. Natural-gas facilities in Texas and New Mexico were advised to determine whether production shortages during extreme cold weather could be effectively and economically mitigated through the adoption of minimum, uniform standards for the winterization of natural-gas production and processing.Ten years have passed since the previous significant cold-weather crisis, and weather events of this magnitude are expected to occur more frequently in the years to come. In light of ERCOT’s unique role as an interconnection and balancing authority, as well as the Texas Railroad Commission’s jurisdiction over in-state gas supply, answering the following questions will be required to help assure suppliers, power generators, grid-asset owners, and customers that the right combination of long-term mitigating actions will be put in place at the wholesale power level. is a partner in McKinsey’s Houston office;  is an associate partner in the Seattle office; and  is a senior partner in the New York office.The authors wish to thank Jamie Brick, Evan Polymeneas and Kelsey Sawyer for their contributions to this article.
