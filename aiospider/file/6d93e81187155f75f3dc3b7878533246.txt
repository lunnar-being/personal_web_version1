With  and prototypes in development, advanced air mobility (AAM) players have great ambitions. By 2030, they could be similar in size across some dimensions to the largest airlines in the world—according to the announced plans of the major players—with similar complexities. Flights are expected to be much shorter than commercial airline travel today (averaging only about 18 minutes), with fewer passengers (one to six, plus a pilot). Fleet sizes are expected to be bigger than those of a typically commercial airline, and the number of AAM flights could be greater by an order of magnitude—approximately 2,200 per day for the largest airlines versus about 20,000 per day for AAM operators.That kind of accelerated cadence—with large numbers of aircraft flying frequent, short flights—will create operational challenges. Ground processes, flight planning, and other aspects all increase in direct proportion to the number of takeoffs and landings. Thus far, much of the discussion about AAM has centered on aircraft design, manufacturing, and certification. Yet operations could be a limiting factor to the industry’s growth, and stakeholders must overcome hurdles in the following areas.Thus far, AAM players have focused primarily on designing and certifying aircraft, but the real question may be this: Can the industry proactively address potential operational issues now to reach its full potential? is a consultant in McKinsey’s Southern California office;  is an associate partner in the Chicago office, where  is a consultant; and  is a partner in the San Francisco office.
