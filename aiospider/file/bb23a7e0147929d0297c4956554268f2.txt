          Details


          

    
            
This revised guidance is primarily aimed at governors, principals, finance directors and/or senior leadership teams of further education (FE) colleges, sixth form colleges and designated institutions in England. It is effective from 1 September 2021.

It sets out increased access to support, for all colleges, through a package of measures called ‘active support’.


  this includes piloting of increased access to diagnostic assessments
  the categories of Prevention and Early Intervention will no longer apply
  there will be a single category of Intervention (using the same criteria as the current category of Formal Intervention)


Insolvency

If a college or creditor initiates insolvency proceedings, notice of those proceedings should be sent by email to ProviderMarketOversight.BST@education.gov.uk or by post to:



Secretary of State for Education 
Department for Education 
Sanctuary Buildings 
Great Smith Street 
London 
SW1P 3BT 



College funding

We will annually publish information on the funding provided to:


  further education (FE) corporations
  sixth form college corporations
  designated institutions


In the period 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020, we have supported 7 colleges with either emergency funding or insolvency financial support. As at March 2020, a total of £35.7 million has been provided.
