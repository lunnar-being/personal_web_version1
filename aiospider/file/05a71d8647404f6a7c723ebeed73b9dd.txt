Dear Friends and Colleagues,Between the pandemic, social unrest, and an election for the ages, a Center dedicated to advancing policy relevant research and mentoring the next generation of leaders has never felt more relevant. As you’ll see in this newsletter, we haven’t let remote work slow us down. Our research and programming on issues ranging from climate change to transatlantic relations are reaching more people than ever. We are proud to have members of our community serve the new administration in Washington. In our "First 100 Days" article, read our Center experts’ recommendations on what the Biden team should prioritize.Pre-pandemic, I often walked around campus to connect with the remarkable people who make this place run. I miss those connections. But we have not and will not stop connecting our expertise and insights with policymakers and the public to help build a better world.
