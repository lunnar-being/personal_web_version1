Those of us who work on climate action, whether it be reducing greenhouse gas emissions to slow warming or addressing the impacts of the warming that's already baked into the system, we tend toward the somber. We're optimists, or we wouldn't be doing it at all, but circumstances can sometimes dampen our outward enthusiasm, to say the least.
