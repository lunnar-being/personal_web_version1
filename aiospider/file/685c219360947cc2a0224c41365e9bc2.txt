          Details


          

    
            
These generic developed principles on regulatory assessment for radioactive substances activities are divided into 8 sections:


  management and leadership for the environment
  radioactive substances management (including waste disposal)
  radiological protection – people and the environment
  site evaluation
  engineering principles
  emergency preparedness and response
  decommissioning
  contaminated land and groundwater


Each section is covered by a separate document on this page.

Review of RSR guidance on environmental principles
We are reviewing and updating all of our radioactive substances regulation (RSR) guidance.

We have withdrawn the document ‘Radioactive Substances Regulation – Environmental Principles, Regulatory Guidance Series, No. RSR 1’.  These generic developed principles on regulatory assessment were formerly part of RSR 1.  Over time, we plan to incorporate them into topic-specific guidance as we carry out our guidance updates.

We have published a new document called Radioactive substances regulation objective and principles and this replaces the RSR fundamental principles that were part of RSR 1.

We have also withdrawn the generic developed principles on regulatory process that were part of RSR 1 and these are no longer part of our current guidance.
