This guidance has been produced by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS) to assist the cities, areas or places that wish to express their interest in bidding for the title of UK City of Culture 2025.

UK City of Culture is a UK-wide programme, developed in collaboration with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The competition is run by DCMS, inviting places across the UK to set out their vision for culture-led regeneration. Derry/Londonderry was the inaugural UK City of Culture 2013 and the competition has been run every four years since. Alongside launching the search for UK City of Culture 2025, DCMS is also committing to running a competition for the UK City of Culture 2029 title.


The new expression of interest stage for the UK City of Culture 2025 competition is designed to be light touch. We do not expect fully formed plans, exhaustive detail or any data at this point. We will consider answers that credibly demonstrate how bidders will approach a particular question if they are successful in being longlisted. If there is a question you do not feel able to answer in full yet, please state your reasons and how you plan to fill that gap in your planning ahead of the long application. At this stage it is about telling your story, articulating your ambitions and demonstrating that you have the knowledge, understanding, backing, and capability to realise your vision.
