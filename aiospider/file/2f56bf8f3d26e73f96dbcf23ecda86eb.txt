Because of coronavirus (COVID-19) there are temporary changes to the way you can check documents. Read guidance about the adjusted process, including asking for documents digitally, making checks on a video call, and what to do if someone cannot provide any accepted documents.


This guidance explains what employers must do to prevent illegal working in the UK by carrying out document checks on people before employing them to make sure they are allowed to work.

You should use it to find out:


  what a right to work check is
  why you need to do right to work checks
  whose documents you should check
  how to carry out checks
  when to carry out initial checks, follow-up checks and what happens under TUPE
  what documents are acceptable



Check if someone can work in the UK using our quick answer tool.


If you’re reasonably satisfied that the worker has an outstanding application with the Home Office that was made before their previous leave expired or has an outstanding appeal against a Home Office decision, you can get a Positive Verification Notice from the Employer Checking Service.

The employer guidance collection includes all documents for employers on preventing illegal working.

You can view previous versions of the guidance by visiting The National Archives.
