A new tool, ‘ListAssist’ will be a single online solution for listing hearings across the crime, civil, family and tribunal jurisdictions in England and Wales. ListAssist will support the individual needs of every jurisdiction and be flexible, to ensure that listing policies can be executed in accordance with local needs.

ListAssist will provide judges with greater certainty that listing decisions will translate into court lists and provide court users with greater certainty that their case will be heard when planned. Listing officers will have more information at their fingertips, giving them more time to focus on administering scheduling and listing on behalf of the judiciary.

The intention is that ListAssist will simplify and streamline elements of the work currently completed by staff when managing schedules and listing hearings, allowing them to focus on more skilled work.

In time, ListAssist will work with other reform projects such as the Video Hearings Service and the new case management system for criminal cases called ‘Common Platform’. This will provide a better, integrated service for all court users.



Key statistics


  500+ Scheduling and Listing Officers will use the service across four jurisdictions
  £3.2 million will be invested in technology
  2022 rollout will deploy ListAssist to court venues in civil, family, tribunals and crime jurisdictions across the whole of England and Wales

      Project team working in close collaboration with the judiciary and operational staff to ensure successful configuration and testing of the service
      Court and tribunal users will benefit from a more reliable system with greater certainty in hearing dates
    
    
      Quality: Improved consistency and standard of service for all court users

Case study

Anna, Listing Officer:

My job is to list cases to be heard at Oxford County Court. Listing cases can be complex, it involves looking at the court diary system and balancing physical resources such as courtrooms, with judicial and staff availability. My role is to do this as efficiently as possible in accordance with directions provided by the judicial office holder. Getting cases listed ensures members of the public can see justice is done. It’s a lot more than administration. For serious cases, having a date confirmed means victims can begin to prepare to come to court and start to visualise life beyond their case.

At the moment we manage cases across multiple systems. I’m looking forward to using ListAssist because it will link to the case management system and pull all the information needed into one place. The system can also do things like auto-list some simpler case types, leaving me more time to focus on working with the judiciary to manage lists, and deal with complex matters that support our partners and court users.

Looking ahead in 2021

By the end of 2021 the service will:


  test the service in early adopter sites to build on pilot feedback from users across multiple jurisdictions
  have developed ListAssist based on user and judicial feedback
  begun rollout of ListAssist with full training
  have started integrating with other reform services across the civil, family, tribunal and crime jurisdictions
