Introduction



Experience is the knowledge or mastery of an activity or subject gained through involvement in or exposure to it.

This section of the Government Analysis Function (AF) Learning Curriculum is to provide you with opportunities to achieve or gain knowledge in a particular field which are relevant to developing in your career.  You’ll find links to various programmes that aim to provide you with valuable experience that help you broaden your skills or aim for progression.

Most of the learning in the AF Learning Curriculum is free but any learning that does have a cost associated is indicated by a £ sign.  We’ve also indicated where learning aligns to the 70:20:10 model.
