On May 28, President Biden unveiled his detailed budget request for fiscal year 2022. The request includes nearly $205 million for the Wind Energy Technologies Office (WETO)—an 86% increase from 2021 appropriations—with $100 million for offshore wind, $40 million for land-based wind, $18 million for distributed wind, and $47 million for grid integration and analysis. These proposed budget increases would support WETO’s R&D strategies for scaling installed wind capacity from 122 GW today to over 500 GW by 2035 through cost reductions, sustainable solutions to environmental and siting concerns, and grid integration.
