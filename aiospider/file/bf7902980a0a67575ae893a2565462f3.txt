The summary outlines the 10 proposals making up the Agile Nations work programme. The proposals have been developed in collaboration across the 7 founding Agile Nations: Canada, Denmark, Italy, Singapore, Japan, UAE and the UK.

The projects cover 6 priority workstreams:


  pro-innovation approaches to regulation
  data and communications
  green tech
  medical devices and treatments
  mobility
  professional business services


These are joint-cooperation activities undertaken by participants to share learning and test new approaches with the aims of bringing key benefits to market.
