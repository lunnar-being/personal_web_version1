AI.gov provides a wealth of information – from policy documents and strategies, to applications of AI, to the latest news and updates from the agencies and federal advisory boards helping shape the activities of the National AI Initiative. Created by Congress, the National AI Initiative seeks to sustain U.S. leadership in AI research and development, ensure the United States leads the world in the development and use of trustworthy AI in the public and private sectors, and prepare the present and future U.S. workforce for the integration of AI systems across all sectors of the economy and society.





“When we level the playing field for tomorrow’s innovators in AI, we can help ensure American competitiveness in technologies for years to come,” said Kei Koizumi, Acting Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. “By prioritizing open access to the benefits of AI for all Americans, AI.gov provides a more accessible window into the initiatives underway across federal agencies so that we can promote AI innovation and its responsible use.”





“AI has become one of the most impactful technologies of the 21st century, providing both opportunities and challenges in nearly every sector of society,” said Dr. Lynne Parker, Director of the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office. “AI.gov provides visibility into the coordinated work across the federal government that is advancing the National AI Initiative.”
AI.gov will continue to expand its resources and offerings to serve the many communities interested in AI research, development, deployment, and governance.
