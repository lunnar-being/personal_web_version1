This guidance covers:


  the pathway for primary hrHPV screening
  the refinement of sample adequacy using findings from the Health Technology Assessment study
  information on what to include in the HPV-U reporting category
  call and recall codes for primary hrHPV screening
  the role and responsibilities for service leads
  advice for managers on laboratory organisation


It replaces:
