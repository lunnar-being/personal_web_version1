This guide is for British citizens travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa or permit.

Entry requirements

If you’re going to Germany to work (or any other EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) you must make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements.

On the day you travel, you’ll need your passport to both:


  have at least 6 months left
  be less than 10 years old (even if it has 6 months or more left)


If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attend business meetings.

These are usually covered by the Schengen visa waiver.

If you’re going for other types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.

The German authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.


You must always check with the German government before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements.


If you’re working in more than one country you will need to check the entry rules of each country.
If you need a passport, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.

Visa and permit documents

This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in Germany. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.

It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with the German authorities or embassy or immigration authorities.

You must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:


  translated
  
‘legalised’ (apostillised) or notarised
  originals, or if copies are acceptable
  signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)
  dated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application


Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa.

This guide uses the same terms used in Germany, so you know which ones to use when speaking to the German authorities.

Check if you need a visa or permit

You do not need a visa or permit if you’re travelling to Germany for up to 90 days in a 180-day period for:


  running or attending job interviews
  going to court as a witness
  attending trade fairs
  board meetings
  meeting clients or customers, including entertainment such as eating at a restaurant
  meeting colleagues, contractors or sellers
  fact-finding visits
  negotiating deals or contracts
  attending, speaking or presenting at a conference, as long as you’re not being paid
  studying for up to 90 days in a rolling 180-day period
  team building activities
  leisure travel such as holidays or visiting friends or family


Or for the following types of training, so long as it’s for the same company or group:


  classroom-based training
  on-the-job training
  shadowing someone’s job


These activities are covered by the Schengen waiver.

Border checks

At the border, you may be asked to show:


  proof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets
  health insurance that covers your stay
  proof of accommodation for your entire stay
  enough money for the duration of your trip
  an invitation letter explaining your trip, or a plan for any training you’ll be doing


Check Germany’s exemptions

Certain types of work and activities do not require a visa or permit because they’re exempt.

All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.

Exempt for 90 days in 12 months

These don’t require a visa or permit in Germany if they’re for less than 90 days in a 12-month period:


  academic staff, such as scientists, technicians, engineers or language teachers working at research or higher education institutions (doesn’t include researchers at accredited research institutions)
  teachers working at state or approved private schools
  internships, if you meet legal requirements – check these with the German authorities
  journalists employed in the UK
  fashion models
  installing software or machinery, or completing technical maintenance, repairs and training – your employer must submit a notification to the German Federal Employment Agency before you start working
  travel guides who accompany tourist groups to Germany – you must keep your regular place of residence in the UK
  translators who need to take part in meetings and discussions in Germany – you must keep your regular place of residence in the UK
  international rail and road traffic industry workers – including drivers who collect and unload deliveries, bus or coach drivers, train operators, train service staff and attendants
  professional drivers – you must be able to show you have the correct driving qualifications and get approval first from the authorities
  sea and air transportation workers, such as international ship crew, sea pilots, technical staff, passenger service staff and plane crew – pilots, engineers and navigators employed by German companies will need a work permit
  speaking or performing in science, the arts, entertainment or sports of special interest (performers and their assistants – you must keep your regular place of residence in the UK – you may be able to get approval to stay longer than 90 days
  working in special cultural or musical events, or in the film and television industry – you may be able to get approval to stay longer than 90 days
  working in a recognised voluntary position or carrying out charitable or religious work


Also, sport and e-sport professionals and trainers working for a German sports organisation or taking part in German competitions with these conditions:


  
    you must be over 16
  
  
    the sport organisation must pay at least 50% of the minimum contribution to pensions insurance
  
  
    the German national association for your sport must recognise your qualifications
  


Exempt for 90 days in 180 days

Directors, board members and business leaders are exempt for up to 90 days in a 180-day period. For more than 90 days you need a long-term work permit from the first day of work.

If you have an EU intra-company transfer permit (EU ICT) from another country you can work in Germany for 90 days in a 180-day period. Your employer has to notify the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF).

All the exemptions are covered by the visa waiver.

Show proof of exemption

You need to be able to show proof that you’re exempt to the authorities on request. This could be:


  an assignment letter
  employment confirmation
  a contract
  proof of required qualifications


Further checks

If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from the German embassy.

Applying for a visa or permit

This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit, but you must check the exact rules and processes with the German embassy or immigration authorities.

Usually, you should apply for a national D visa so you can start working. You then apply for a longer-term residence permit once in Germany.

Taking your family

You may be able to apply for dependant permits if you have a family and want them to join you. It depends on the type of work permit you have.

Find out more about taking your family with you.

Long-term visas and permits

Germany only offers long-term visas and permits for work. They are valid for up to 4 years depending on which one you need.

You must apply for one if your profession isn’t exempt or you’re in Germany because you’re:


  transferring to a German branch of a UK-based company (intra-corporate transfer), even if it’s for a short period of time
  working for a German company on a German employment contract
  providing services to a client in Germany
  providing services as a self-employed worker or setting up a business
  conducting research work


Transferring to a German branch of a UK-based company

You need one of these permits if your UK-based company moves you to a German branch to work:


  international staff exchange programme
  EU intra-company transfer permit (EU ICT)


International staff exchange
If you need to work at a German branch temporarily, your employer can use the international staff exchange.

To qualify your employer must:


  
    be registered with the personnel exchange department of the German labour office
  
  
    have a branch in Germany and exchange staff with their offices in other countries
  


You must:


  
    have at least a bachelor’s level degree
  
  
    keep your UK employment contract
  
  
    stay on UK payroll
  


The international staff exchange permit takes 8 to 12 weeks to get. It’s valid for up to 3 years and can’t be extended.

If you have a family they can join you as dependants.

How it works

You need to check with the German authorities on the exact process. This is a rough guide to help you prepare.



Your employer submits a work permit application for pre-approval from the Federal Employment Agency. This speeds up the process. You can also apply directly at the embassy or immigration office.


You submit a national D visa application with the necessary documents to the German embassy. You can also submit it directly at the immigration office in Germany, but won’t be able to start working until you have your final residence permit.


You register your address at the local city hall within 14 days of arriving in Germany, if staying for more than 3 months.


You submit a residence permit application at your local immigration office – check with them which forms and documents you need. You only need to do this if you’re staying in Germany after your national D visa expiry date.



Application documents

German authorities may request different documents at different stages of the process. Usually, they need:


  completed permit application form
  passport for you and any dependants – valid for 6 months, less than 10 years old, and with at least 2 blank pages
  degree or qualification certificate relevant to the job
  CV
  job description
  signed assignment agreement with your employer

‘legalised’ (apostilled)  marriage certificate, if married
health insurance cover in Germany for you and any dependants
  proof of residence in Germany, including signed confirmation from the landlord (required once you get to Germany)

  up to 3 years

  have specialist knowledge in the field
