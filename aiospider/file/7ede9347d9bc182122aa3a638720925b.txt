The Department of Energy (DOE) today announced the publication of the Energy Storage Grand Challenge (ESGC) , a comprehensive review of the state of the art and marketplace potential of new energy storage technologies for domestic and global markets. The report provides a portrait of the opportunities and challenges present in the emergent energy storage industry, as well as technology- and application- specific analyses.Several other DOE offices contributed to the report: include the , the , the , the , and the . This landmark publication is part of a larger DOE effort to promote a full-spectrum approach to technology development and maturation, embodied by the ESGC slogan of “At the Office of Technology Transitions, we have the singular focus of delivering the greatest return on the taxpayer dollars invested in our world-leading R&D enterprise, supporting the development of new technologies from the ground up with the intent of creating new opportunities to innovate and improving American lives. By doubling down on establishing clear commercial pathways for new, disruptive energy storage technologies, we are setting up America’s innovators for success as they develop new, global markets in this critical sector.”The ESGC Energy Storage Market Report supplements the technology transition track of the , which defines clear roles and responsibilities in technology development, manufacturing and supply chain, technology transitions, policy and valuation, and workforce development.The U.S. Department of Energy's  expands the public impact of the department's research and development (R&D) portfolio to advance the economic, energy and national security interests of the nation. OTT serves as the "front door" to DOE's National Laboratories, sites, and facilities, where it encourages the efficient and effective transition of DOE-powered innovations from the lab bench toward the marketplace.
