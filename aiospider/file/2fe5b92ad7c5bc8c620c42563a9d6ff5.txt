Almost all Japanese financial decision makers are unsure or pessimistic about the economic recovery post COVID-19. Over 40% of consumers expect the economy and their personal financial situations to worsen in the next three months, down from over 50% last month. Only one quarter of consumers are concerned about their job security, and half have nine months or more in savings to live off. A majority of consumers feel banks are performing below expectations and would like them to improve their websites to allow for more seamless online transactions.
