CX(s) Applied: A9, A11Geothermal Technologies OfficeLocation(s): DCOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to authorize the administration of a prize competition (The American-Made Geothermal Manufacturing Prize, or “Prize”) designed to catalyze manufacturing innovation in the American geothermal industry by harnessing the rapid advances additive manufacturing can provide in improving design, fabrication and functionality. The Prize would be administered by the Geothermal Technologies Office (GTO) and the Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) in partnership with the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Through the proposed Prize, DOE would progressively award federal funding in the form of cash prizes to competitors and collaborating organizations. Additional funding may be provided to two grand prize winners for field testing their tools.
