The pressure on boards has been increasing as they work to manage the continuing impact of the pandemic on the direction and strategies of the organizations they serve. At the same time, board members must simultaneously grapple with the implications of rapid technological shifts, and the need to embrace external perspectives about the role and purpose of the company, both in their communities and in society as a whole. Today we’re pleased to bring you a discussion on the role board directors are playing in navigating this complex environment, with a specific focus on how boards are handling risk. We’ll hear from Celia Huber, a senior partner in our Silicon Valley office, who leads our Board Services work in North America, and Olivia White, a partner in our San Francisco office who leads our work in enterprise risk management.
