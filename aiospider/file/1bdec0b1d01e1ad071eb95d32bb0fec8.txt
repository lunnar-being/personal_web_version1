The National Security and Investment Act comes into force on 4 January 2022. It allows the government to scrutinise and intervene in certain acquisitions made by anyone, including businesses and investors, that could harm the UK’s national security.

From 4 January 2022, subject to certain criteria, you will be legally required to tell the government about acquisitions of certain entities in 17 sensitive areas of the economy (called ‘notifiable acquisitions’). This document provides guidance on types of acquisitions that can be classed as a notifiable acquisition.

You should also read  guidance on preparing for the National Security and Investment Act to understand the wider rules around acquisitions and check what you need to do from 4 January 2022.
