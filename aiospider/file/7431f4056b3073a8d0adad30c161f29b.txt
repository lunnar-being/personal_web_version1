Award Number: DE-EE0009089CX(s) Applied: A9, A11Building Technologies OfficeLocation(s): MTOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide federal funding to Confluence Communications to leverage existing infrastructure and content previously developed to design model curriculums for four academic programs: high school, “boot camp” for transitioning workers, 2-year associate’s degree, and continuing education for homebuilders. The project would design each of these curriculums so they could be utilized by other similar programs around the country, thus increasing the focus of energy efficiency in the construction trades.
