Award Number: DE-EE0008989CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): ILOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Northern Illinois University (NIU) to develop on-device lead absorbing films for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The project would seek to address lead leakages in PSCs and consequently, mitigate against the public health risks associated with lead contamination. Solar photovoltaic (PV) films would be developed with the ability to sequester leaked aqueous lead from damaged solar PV devices, without affecting performance efficiency.
