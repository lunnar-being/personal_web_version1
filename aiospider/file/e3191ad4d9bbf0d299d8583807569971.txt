          Details


          

    
            
All government departments and their related organisations must make sure that they meet the minimum mandatory Government Buying Standards (GBS) standards when buying goods and services. We also encourage the wider public sector to specify the minimum mandatory standards in tenders.

We encourage everyone to meet the best practice standards, which go further than the mandatory standards.

The product specifications set out in the Government Buying Standards are aimed primarily at public sector organisations procuring goods or services. However, any organisation concerned about sustainable procurement may choose to follow them or to specify them in tenders.
