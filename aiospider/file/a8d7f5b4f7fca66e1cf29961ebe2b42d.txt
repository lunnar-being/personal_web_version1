Award Number: DE-EE0009021CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): TNOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) to develop and test an end-to-end aggregation and control architecture for Distributed Energy Resources (DER). The architecture would be designed to enable behind-the-meter (BTM) solar photovoltaic (PV) systems to be co-located with other DERs to provide both bulk power and distribution grid services. The project would be completed over three Budget Periods (BPs), with a Go/No-Go Decision Point in between each BP.
