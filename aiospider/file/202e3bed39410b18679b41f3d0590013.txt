The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) will be a crucial step to achieving the UKâ€™s net zero target. The sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be phased out by 2030 and from 2035, all new cars and vans must be zero emissions at the tailpipe.

While EV technology, vehicles and infrastructure have developed rapidly in recent years, people still understandably have a lot of questions about this new technology.

This leaflet addresses 19 common misconceptions surrounding EVs and EV charging infrastructure.
