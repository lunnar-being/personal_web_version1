This guidance document covers the period 1 August 2021 to 31 July 2022 and is our current advice for the funding year. We know that providers are working through exceptional circumstances due to coronavirus (COVID-19). We may publish further updates to this guidance document about the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) on our funding rules as these become clear. We will tell you about any changes in our ESFA updates.

You might find our published information about what colleges and other providers need to do during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak useful.

For 2021 to 2022, we have made the following updates to this guidance:


  the introduction – this now includes arrangements related to coronavirus (COVID-19)
  Retention – the funding methodology is temporarily using an average factor
  Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2019 – the funding methodology now uses the 2019 Index, rather than the 2015 one
  Exceptional in-year growth – we made minor additions to clarify the providers eligible for growth and to state that we have the power to recover growth awards
  Formula protection funding – we no longer pay formula protection funding
