American financial decision makersâ€™ expectations for the economy in three months have declined since the end of September. 57 percent of consumers believe their current financial situation is strong or somewhat strong, and over 80 percent expect it to remain the same or improve in the next 3 months. Approximately one third of households report reduced income and savings, and almost 40 percent report reduced spending. Job security concerns remain for over 40 percent of consumers. Many Americans continue to have challenges paying their bills in full, with student loans and short term loans showing the highest rate of delinquency. The majority of consumers feel their bank is performing per expectations and would like them to waive late fees and reduce minimum payments on credit cards. Over 65% of consumers are unsure or pessimistic about the future of the economy.
