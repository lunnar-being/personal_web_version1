Award Number: DE-EE0008946CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.3, B3.6Water Power Technologies OfficeLocation(s): CAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Natel Energy to develop the concept design for a low-head generation hydroelectric turbine. Natel Energy would focus on the development of modular turbine designs that can provide safe passage for fish, as well as turbine runner blades that would reduce fish mortality rates. A prototype turbine runner would be developed, fabricated, and tested as part of the project. A goal of the project is to develop a runner that it is more fish friendly than previous runners.
