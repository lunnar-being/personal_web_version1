Standard terms
Standard terms govern the commercial relationship between Legal Aid Agency (LAA) and the provider.

Specification
This sets out the rules for providing and being paid for CLA related contract work. It’s divided into provisions of general application (Section 1 to 8) and category specific rules and payment schemes for the categories of law (Section 9 onwards, as applicable).

Separate provisions apply to controlled work (sections 5 and 6) and licensed work (sections 7 and 8). The licensed work section is only relevant for contracts in the discrimination categories.

Contract for signature
The contract for signature is the document which gives effect to the contract as a whole. Use the sample contract for signature for illustration as contents vary between providers.

Key performance indicators (KPIs)
The LAA sets out contractually enforceable measures (KPIs) by which we monitor performance. The document explains the consequences of breaching KPIs.
