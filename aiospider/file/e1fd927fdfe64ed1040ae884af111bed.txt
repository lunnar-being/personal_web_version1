 in 2020, InsureTech Connect (ITC), the largest gathering of insurance industry professionals in the world, returned in person to Las Vegas this year. The exhibit halls were full of more than 5,000 attendees representing a broad swath of the insurance industry, including investors, insurtech start-ups, solutions providers, brokers, distributors, and established carriers.As we talked with clients, listened to expert panelists, and walked from booth to booth, a number of discussion themes emerged that had exciting implications for incumbents and start-ups:We left ITC inspired and excited about the year ahead. While 2021 has been another record year of new capital going into insurtechs, we also saw many insurtechs suffer declining valuation after they went public. To date, few if any of the insurtechs have achieved the financial performance of leading incumbents. However, we were struck by the confidence attackers have in their ability to close the gap by not only leveraging modern tech stacks and using analytics to a greater degree but also innovating the core-products offering.2022 promises to be a year of refined appetite for specialized risks, innovative product design, and transformation across internal operations and IT. Opportunities abound for insurtechs and carriers interested in disruption, , and acquisition. Weâ€™re already looking forward to ITC 2022.
