 $399,943;  $399,943  (Riverside, California) seek to combine experiments and quantum calculations to investigate using carbon as a catalyst for the plasma-driven pyrolysis of methane for low-cost hydrogen production. The proposed investigation will: 1) harness large-scale quantum calculations to predict thermodynamics and kinetics; 2) use in situ diagnostics to characterize the interaction between plasma-activated gas-phase species and plasma-activated carbon surfaces; 3) combine experimental and computational results to gain fundamental insights into the plasma-initiated processes and improve performance in terms of hydrogen yield and energy cost; and 4) provide training opportunities to the diverse group of minority students attending the university.$400,000; $400,000 $399,435; $399,435   $398,969;  $398,969$400,000; $400,000—() aims to formulate mathematical models and develop computational methodologies to allow the design of novel gas separation processes, along with the microporous materials they rely upon, in a co-optimization paradigm. This high-fidelity process modeling effort will be coupled with data-driven materials design methodologies, realizing a novel integrated, process-materials co-optimization framework that will be implemented within DOE’s IDAES Integrated Platform, an open-source computational platform for the modeling and optimization of advanced energy systems. $400,000;  $400,000  $400,000;  $400,000 —  (Columbus, Ohio) seeks to develop two enabling techniques for welding repair of creep strength-enhanced ferritic Grade 91 and 92 steel components: 1) microstructure detection using ultrasonic inspection; and 2) hardness prediction using a computational model for multi-pass, multi-layer dissimilar metal welding. The project aims to generate high-quality data from weld coupons fabricated using a high-deposition rate process based on hot wire gas tungsten arc welding and Gleeble® samples containing simulated weld microstructures, especially those with a different extent of tempered martensite.$400,000; $400,000  $400,000;  $400,000 — () is focused on the delivery of an integrated 5G-TSN architecture capable of supporting fossil-fired power generation systems’ operational data, while providing the required deterministic quality of service. The proposed research will demonstrate the ability to design a 5G-TSN network capable of providing the necessary quality of service and security for measurement and control of oxy-combustor systems. $400,000;  $400,000  $399,481;  $15,000;  $414,481
