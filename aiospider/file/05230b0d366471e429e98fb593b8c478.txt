Introduction



Technical is the demonstration of specific professional skills, knowledge or qualifications.

Roles within the Government Analysis Function (AF) tend to be of a technical nature and this is the most extensive section of the AF Learning Curriculum.

On this page you’ll find opportunities to help you gain the specific technical skills, knowledge or qualifications to continue to advance your career.

The technical learning below aligns to the 70:20:10 learning model and covers a wide range of subjects including improving your Microsoft Office skills, learning new programming languages, calculating sample design estimation and much more.

Most of the learning in the AF Learning Curriculum is free but any learning that does have a cost associated is indicated by a £ sign.

Get started with a new technical subject or take your learning further by exploring this range of topics.
