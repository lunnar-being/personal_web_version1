The NSTC was established by 
Executive Order
 on November 23, 1993. The NSTC is a cabinet-level council of advisers to the President on science and technology (S&T), established to achieve the following functions:





To coordinate the S&T policy-making process;
To ensure that S&T policy decisions and programs are consistent with the President’s policy priorities;
To integrate the President’s S&T policy agenda across the Federal Government;
To ensure that S&T are considered in developing and implementing Federal policies and programs; and to further international S&T cooperation.





The work of the NSTC is organized under six primary committees:





S&T Enterprise
Environment
Homeland and National Security
Science
STEM Education
Technology





It also includes two special committees: The Joint Committee on Research Environments, that houses the 
Scientific Integrity Task Force
, and the 
Select Committee on AI
.





Each of these committees oversees subcommittees and working groups focused on different aspects of science and technology and working to coordinate across the federal government. These committees and their sub-entities are co-chaired by an OSTP representative and Department and Agency representatives.





Membership





The membership of the NSTC is made up of the Vice President, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, Cabinet Secretaries and Agency Heads with significant science and technology responsibilities, and heads of other White House offices.
