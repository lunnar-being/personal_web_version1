The Carbon Rivers and University of Tennessee, Knoxville, blade recycling process takes decommissioned wind turbine blades (left), mechanically reduces them into small pieces (middle), and then uses a novel pyrolysis technique to recover high-quality glass fiber (right).  Wind turbine components like blades can fail and require replacement earlier than expected, indicating a need for manufacturing methods and materials that optimize longer life cycles.Subscribe to learn more about WETO R&D projects, news, accomplishments, and recent publications.Subscribe to the WETO e-newsletter to stay informed on the latest wind energy news, events, publications, and updates.
