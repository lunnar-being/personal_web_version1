This guide is for British citizens travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa or permit.

Entry requirements

If you’re going to Estonia to work (or any other EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) you must make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements.

On the day you travel, you’ll need your passport to both:


  have at least 6 months left
  be less than 10 years old (even if it has 6 months or more left)


If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attend business meetings. These are usually covered by the Schengen visa waiver.

If you’re going for other types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.

Estonia’s authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.


You must always check with Estonia’s government before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements


If you’re working in more than one country you’ll need to check the entry rules of each country.

If you need a passport, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.

Visa and permit documents

This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in Estonia. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.

It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with Estonia’s authorities or embassy.

You must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:


  translated
  
‘legalised’ (apostillised) or notarised
  originals, or if copies are acceptable
  signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)
  dated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application


Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa. This guide uses the same terms used in Estonia, so you know which ones to use when speaking to Estonia’s authorities.

Check if you need a visa or permit

You don’t need a visa or permit if you’re travelling to Estonia for up to 90 days in a 180-day period for:


  attending business meetings
  buying goods for sale outside the country
  providing consultations
  touring or inspecting a company facility
  fitting, maintaining, or repairing equipment
  attending trade shows, seminars, conferences or conventions
  attending training


These activities are covered by the Schengen visa waiver.

Border checks

At the border, you may be asked to show:


  proof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets
  health insurance that covers your entire stay
  proof of accommodation for your entire stay
  enough money for the duration of your trip
  an invitation letter or training plan from your employer that explains your trip


Check Estonia’s exemptions

Certain types of work-related activities don’t require a visa or permit because they’re exempt.

All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.

For Estonia you may not need a visa or permit if you’re:


  working on a one-off temporary basis for up to 5 days in a 30-day period
  a journalist accredited by the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for up to 270 days in a 12-month period
  a supervisor or director of an Estonian branch of a non-Estonian company for up to 5 days in a 30-day period


Exemptions are covered by the visa waiver.

Show proof of exemption

You need to be able to show proof that you’re exempt to the authorities on request. This could be:


  an assignment letter
  employment confirmation
  a contract
  proof of required qualifications


Further checks

If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from Estonia’s embassy.

Applying for a visa or permit

This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit to help you prepare, but you’ll need to check the exact rules and processes with Estonia’s embassy or other authorities.

Taking your family

If you’re going to Estonia for short-term work, family members won’t be able to get dependant permits. They may be able to join you for up to 90 days under the visa waiver.

There may be different rules for taking families if you have a long-term permit.

Short and long-term visa and permits

You can get a short- or long-term visa if you’re:


  working for a company in Estonia for up to 365 days in a 455-day period (short-term employment registration)
  working remotely for a UK company, or as a UK-registered freelancer in IT, finance or marketing for up to 1 year (digital nomad visa)


You need to apply for a temporary residence permit if you’re in Estonia for 1 year or more because you’re:


  transferring long term from a UK-based company to a branch in Estonia
  working for an Estonian company on a long-term Estonian contract
  carrying out self-employed work, investing in or starting a business in Estonia
  conducting research work


Temporary residence permits are valid for up to 5 years depending on which one you need.

Short-term employment registration

The registration of short-term employment allows you to carry out work in Estonia for up to 365 days in a 455-day period.

If you travel to Estonia without a visa you will still need to ensure that your travels are in line with the Schengen visa waiver rules. If you do not want to use your 90 in 180-day Schengen day allowance, or you need to stay in Estonia for more than 90 days, you will need a long-stay visa.

To qualify you must:


  have the required qualifications, professional skills and knowledge, state of health and work experience for the job
  be working for a company registered in Estonia
  be paid the average annual gross salary in Estonia or twice that if you’re a top specialist


It takes 15 business days for the short-term employment to be registered. In urgent cases, you can start working in Estonia as soon as your application has been submitted. Your right to work can be withdrawn if you don’t meet the conditions.

How it works



Your employer applies for your registration of short-term employment. They can do this online, in person (or via an authorised representative) at a local police and border guard service office, or by post. They must do this at least 10 days before you need to start working.


You apply for a long stay visa from the Estonian consulate or embassy if needed.



Application documents

Estonia’s authorities may request different documents at different stages of the process. Usually, they need:


  completed application form for short-term employment registration

  completed application form for long-stay visa (if needed)
  UK passport for you and any dependants, valid for 6 months with 2 blank pages
  colour passport photo taken within 6 months of applying - 1 digital photo (1,300px x 1,600px) for the short-term employment registration and 1 printed photo (35mm x 45mm) for the long-stay visa (if needed)
  most recent bank statements
  proof of your booked return ticket
  travel and medical insurance certificate
  proof of your accommodation in Estonia
  support letter from your UK employer
  invitation letter from Estonia


Certain types of work and activities may require additional documents including:


  teachers or lecturers at an educational organisation
  research activities
  top specialists, experts, advisers or consultants
  work for a start-up
  seasonal work – this can only be registered for up to 270 days in a 365-day period
  holders of an EU intra-company transfer (EU ICT) permit issued by another EU country
  minister of religions, such as a nun or monk
  arts activities, such as working for an art organisation
  sports activities and jobs, such as coaches, referees and athletes
  transferred (posted) workers, including those providing services to Estonian clients – if you continue to be employed, paid and under the management of your UK company
  youth programs approved by the Ministry of Education


You should check what documents you would be expected to show with the Estonian authorities.

Registration is valid for the duration of your assignment up to 365 days in a 455-day period.

It may be possible to register your employment for longer if you’re working as a:


  teacher
  lecturer
  researcher
  top specialist
  for a start-up company


Estonia’s authorities decide this on a case-by-case basis.

You can’t extend your registration beyond 365 days and will need to wait for 90 days before re-applying or apply for a temporary residence permit.
