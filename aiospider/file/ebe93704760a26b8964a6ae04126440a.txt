          Details


          

    
            
The UK government has a policy on aligning UK international support for the clean energy transition whereby in most cases it will no longer provide support for the fossil fuel energy sector overseas.

Accordingly, the eligibility of companies engaged in certain activities involving fossil fuels for an Export Development Guarantee (EDG) will be assessed by reference to a revenue threshold test.

Read this guidance to learn more about how our EDG can support companies transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy.
