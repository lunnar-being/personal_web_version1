June is Ocean Month, and to celebrate  is sharing profiles of Energy Department staff in ocean-related careers. Meet Vince Neary.Vince Neary is the Marine Renewable Energy Technologies Lead at Sandia National Laboratories. Vince has spent the last ten-years working on a wide-range of topics advancing marine renewable energy, including modeling and measuring tidal and wave environments for resource characterization and assessment, experimental testing and numerical modeling of marine energy conversion technologies, and benchmarking their techno-economic performance. His recent work is focused on tidal and wave energy resource characterization and classification to support regional energy planning, project development and type-certification. Vince is a registered professional engineer and a Fellow of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) recognized for the breadth of his contributions to research, teaching, and practice in fluid mechanics and hydraulic engineering.The earth is the only known planet to have oceans.Listen to old sea shanties or watch a movie or documentary: Master and Commander, Das Boot, All is Lost, Mutiny on the Bounty.The contributions of great inventors (Wright brothers, Edison, Tesla, Maxwell), scientists (Newton, Bernoulli, Einstein, Cousteau) and engineers (DaVinci, Prandtl, Brunel).R&D to improve the techno-economic performance of marine renewable energy technologies and to provide useful data, information, tools and standards to support a growing marine renewable energy industry.Be curious. Be passionate. Read the history of those who made great contributions to science and engineering and be inspired. Be hopeful. Protect our oceans.For more Ocean Month profiles and STEM resources, visit www.energy.gov/STEM
