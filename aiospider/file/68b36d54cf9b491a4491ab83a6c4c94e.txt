Award Number: DE-EE0009029CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): CAOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to Operant Networks to develop and test networking software for utility scale solar photovoltaic (PV) applications. Specifically, multi-party trust (MPT) solutions would be developed for distributed energy resources (DER) applications. MPTs refer to trust models for smart devices that are accessed by multiples parties for the sending/receiving of remote commands. Operant Networks would develop an MPT solution for DERs which would seek to mitigate cybersecurity concerns associated with the current state of the technology. The project would be completed over three Budget Periods (BPs), with a Go/No-Go Decision Point in between each BP.
