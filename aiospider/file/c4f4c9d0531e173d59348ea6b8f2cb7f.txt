Most Swiss consumers believe that the impact on their routines will last beyond the next two months, but are more optimistic about the their personal financial situation. About one-third of consumers continue to report reduced income and spending and some have delayed purchases because of the crisis. Twenty percent of consumers have tried other brands and places to shop, driven largely by availability, convenience, and value. Forty percent consumers are already engaging in out-of-home activities, while the others are waiting for other milestones. Most people plan to continue their current out-of-home activity level and stay away from shared services and crowded spaces, which have the highest levels of concern.These exhibits are based on survey data collected in Switzerland from June 18â€“21, 2020.
