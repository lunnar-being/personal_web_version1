Award Number: DE-EE0008996CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Solar Energy Technologies OfficeLocation(s): NYOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to GE Research (GE) to fabricate turbine components for Condensed Solar Power (CSP) applications using powder metallurgy, near-net-shape (NNS) hot isostatic pressed (HIP) technology. Specifically, a turbine nozzle ring, turbine case, and cylindrical structure would be fabricated as a demonstration of the technologyâ€™s viability. The technology would be developed so as to reduce manufacturing costs, as compared to current technologies. The project would be completed over two Budget Periods (BPs), with a Go/No-Go Decision Point in between each BP.
