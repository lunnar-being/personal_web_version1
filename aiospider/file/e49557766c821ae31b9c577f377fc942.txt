B2B buyers aren’t just moving to omnichannel. They’ve arrived. Given the choice of in-person, remote, and e-commerce channels, purchasers have shown they want them all.
 Even as in-person engagement has reemerged since August 2020, buyers have made clear that they prefer a cross-channel mix, choosing in-person, remote, and digital self-serve interactions in equal measure.
 Eight in ten B2B decision makers say that omnichannel is as or more effective than traditional methods—a sentiment that has grown sharply throughout the past year.
 Despite ongoing market volatility, six in ten respondents plan to maintain or grow their operating expenditure investments over the next five years. And nearly half plan to expand their capital expenditure over the same period, a six percentage-point increase since August 2020.
 Sixty-four percent of B2Bs intend to increase the number of hybrid sellers over the next six months, making this model the lead sales role.
 (marginally outpacing in-person). And 41 percent of leaders say it is their most effective sales route, beating out in-person (37 percent) and video (31 percent).
