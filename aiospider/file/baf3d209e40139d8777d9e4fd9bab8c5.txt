As cities grapple with population growth, climate change, and rapid urbanization, the case to embrace mass transit is clear. A system that converges the personalization of cars, the capacity of mass transit, the speed of air travel, and ambitious sustainability goals would be an exciting prospect for the future of transport. The Virgin Hyperloop, presented as an “Inspiring Idea” at the 2021 GII Summit, has the potential to offer an efficient, clean-energy-based mass-transportation system—one that, if fully realized, could serve tens of thousands of passengers per hour, on-demand, with no direct emissions. In this video, Virgin Hyperloop CEO and cofounder Josh Giegel outlines his vision for mass adoption by the end of the decade.
