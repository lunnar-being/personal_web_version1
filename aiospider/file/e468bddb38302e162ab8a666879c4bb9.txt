These documents consist of vital updates for the forensic community and contain validation evidence in support of the Fingermark Visualisation Manual and digital forensics techniques. This information provides support to the United Kingdom Forensic Enhancement and Digital Laboratories to achieve and maintain ISO 17025. The availability of this validation data is endorsed by the UK Forensic Science Regulator and it is necessary for these documents to be formally issued, controlled and maintained.

These documents were produced by a team of scientists within the Dstl Security Systems Programme. This team integrated across to Dstl in April 2018 from the Home Office Centre for Applied Science and Technology (CAST), which was previously known as the Home Office Scientific Development Branch (HOSDB), Police Scientific Development Branch (PSDB) and Scientific Research and Development Branch (SRDB). In order to maintain one single archive for these reference documents, this series of publications includes those produced prior to April 2018.
