Dstl researches and develops new science and technologies to support the UK’s defence and security. Where possible we also try to get more impact from these innovations, and benefit the UK’s prosperity, by making them available to license.

Companies can license available technologies in 2 ways:


  The Easy Access IP scheme, which allows certain technologies to be licensed for free in combination with a simple licence agreement.
  
Ploughshare Innovations, which is Dstl’s technology transfer office and was established in 2005 as a separate organisation to commercialise Dstl’s intellectual property. Ploughshare is wholly owned by the Secretary of State for Defence and has access to innovations from other parts of government as well as Dstl. It commercialises intellectual property through licence deals and the creation of spin-out companies.


We also offer businesses the opportunity to work together with us to deliver science and technology for our customers, either by selling directly to us or being part of our wider supply chain.
