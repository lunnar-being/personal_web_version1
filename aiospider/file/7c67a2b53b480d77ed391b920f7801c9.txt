We’ve long known that the key to unlocking sustainable performance is not just to focus on results. Rather, lasting impact occurs when companies apply equal rigor and resources both to how they make money  how they run the place – something we refer to as . Companies with this dual focus outperform their peers on almost every financial indicator we’ve seen.
However, given the challenges posed by today’s environment, we’re finding that value creation and value capture are happening disproportionately at the edges of an organization. Take, for example, a biopharma company whose primary competitive advantage lies within its R&D team’s ability to innovate faster than others, or an insurance company whose salespeople have built a loyal and robust client base. In these cases, it is the people on the frontlines who are creating significant value.

While performance and health at the organization level continues to remain core to creating lasting results, building a true competitive advantage requires applying that same lens at the individual level to better inspire and enable people on the ground. For leaders, this means doubling down on four areas:

When you put the four pieces together, what you see is an organization that has a clear path forward; one that offers a broader work environment that supports and enables the operational aspirations, where every person comes into work each day knowing the impact and value they bring to the table and with clear goals to work toward and tailored coaching to ensure their success.

Imagine the value you could create and the impact you could have on your company’s greatest asset – your people – if you were to manage performance and health with the same rigor for both the organization  the individuals.
