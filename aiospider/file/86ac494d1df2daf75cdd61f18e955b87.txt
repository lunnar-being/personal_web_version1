Live animals, animal products, plants, plant products and wood from the EU will need to enter Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland) via a border control post (BCP) from July 2021.

This rule already applies to those animals and goods coming from a country outside the EU.

If your port or airport will receive these animals and goods from the EU or from a country outside the EU you’ll need to be designated as a BCP by your competent authority.

In England, your competent authority is:


  Defra for live animals, animal products, plants, plant products and wood
  Food Standards Agency for high risk food or feed of non-animal origin subject to an increased level of controls at BCPs and plastic kitchenware from China


In Scotland, your competent authority is Food Standards Scotland or the Scottish Government.

In Wales, your competent authority is the Welsh Government.

The animals and goods will undergo official controls checks at the BCP.

BCP requirements

To be designated by the competent authority, BCPs must comply with requirements on facilities, equipment and staff. For example, a BCP must have:


  sufficient number of suitably qualified staff
  premises and facilities appropriate to the nature of volume of consignments,
  equipment to enable the performance of checks, including IT equipment
  access to service of official laboratories
  arrangements in place to prevent risks of cross contamination and comply with biosecurity standards


These requirements are set out in Article 64(3) of Regulation (EU) 2017/625 on official controls (OCR).

To comply with biosecurity standards, your BCP must also meet requirements for:


  unloading areas
  inspection rooms/areas
  storage facilities
  changing rooms


These requirements are set out in Commission Regulation 2019/1014.

The competent authority will withdraw or suspend the BCP designation when:


  the BCP no longer complies with the minimum requirements
  its activities pose a risk to public, animal and plant health


Read more about information on official controls at BCPs.

Applying to become a BCP to receive animals and goods from both EU and non-EU countries

If you need to construct a new BCP or extend an existing BCP at your port or airport, you  must apply to have your BCP assessed and designated by the competent authority.

To apply to be designated as a BCP you should send your expression of interest or request a BCP application form from:


  
DEFRA-OCR@defra.gov.uk for BCPs in England and Wales
  
BCPScotland@gov.scot for BCPs in Scotland


Your application must include:


  the location of the BCP and the designated customs area
  a description of the expected imports (type of commodities, volume)


After you submit your application

Relevant authorities will contact you to:


  advise on next steps
  assist with the submission of the building plan


The relevant authorities are:


  Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) for BCPs for animals, animal products, plants and plant products
  Forestry Commission (FC) for BCPs for wood products


In Scotland, you’ll get advice from Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture (SASA) for BCPs for plants and plant products

Approval of the building plan

The relevant authorities (APHA, FC, SASA) will approve the building plan where it demonstrates that it complies with BCP minimum requirements.

For BCPs for animals, animal products, plants, plant products and wood, Defra will confirm whether it supports the approval.

During the build

The relevant authorities will visit the BCP site to:


  check that the building work follows the approved plan
  recommend corrective actions to meet BCP requirements if necessary
  prepare a report with their recommendations about the BCP designation for the designation competent authorities to consider


When your BCP is designated

If your BCP is for animals, animal products, plants, plant products or wood:


  in England, Defra will notify you by email
  in Scotland and Wales, the Scottish and Welsh government will notify you


Defra will put the BCP on the lists of BCPs for:


  animals and animal products
  plants and plant products


How long designation takes
How long it takes for your BCP to be designated will depend on the:


  number of commodities in the scope of the designation
  complexity of building plans
  pace of construction


Contacts

For enquiries about:


  BCPs for animals, animal products, plants, plant products or wood in England or Wales, email Defra at DEFRA-OCR@defra.gov.uk
