Award Number: DE-EE0008832CX(s) Applied: A9, B3.6Fuel Cell Technologies OfficeLocation(s): ILOffice(s): Golden Field OfficeThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to provide funding to University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) to research and develop new methods for the production of austenitic steels for use in hydrogen application systems. The project would seek to develop the steels in such a way as to be resistant to hydrogen embrittlement, while maintaining high strength and low production costs, as compared to the current state of the technology. The project would be completed over two Budget Periods, with a Go/No-Go Decision Point in between each BP.
